       "  'AB We demonstrate that an unlexicalized PCFG can parse much more accurately than previously shown, by making use of simple, linguistically motivated state splits, which break down false independence assumptions latent in a vanilla treebank grammar. Indeed, its performance of 86.36% (LP/LR F-1) is better than that of early lexicalized PCFG models, and surprisingly close to the current state-of-the-art. This result has potential uses beyond establishing a strong lower bound on the maximum possible accuracy of unlexicalized models: an unlexicalized PCFG is much more compact, easier to replicate, and easier to interpret than more complex lexical models, and the parsing algorithms are simpler, more widely understood, of lower asymptotic complexity, and easier to optimize.\\n',\n",

We evaluate Brown clusters, Collobert and Weston (2008) embeddings, and HLBL (Mnih & Hinton, 2009) embeddings of words on both NER and chunking. We use near state-of-the-art supervised baselines, and find that each of the three word representations improves the accuracy of these baselines.

A general problem of this approach is that there is only a loose relation to the final translation quality on unseen text. In this paper, we analyze various training criteria which directly optimize translation quality. These training criteria make use of recently proposed automatic evaluation metrics. We describe a new algorithm for efficient training an unsmoothed error count. We show that significantly better results can often be obtained if the final evaluation criterion is taken directly into account as part of the training procedure.\\n',\n",

Our model makes use of a generalization of the commonly used Dirichlet distributions called Pitman-Yor processes which produce power-law distributions more closely resembling those in natural languages. We show that an approximation to the hierarchical Pitman-Yor language model recovers the exact formulation of interpolated Kneser-Ney, one of the best smoothing methods for n-gram language models.

       "  \"   This paper presents WOE, an open IE system which improves dramatically on TextRunner's precision and recall. The key to WOE's performance is a novel form of self-supervised learning for open extractors -using heuristic matches between Wikipedia infobox attribute values and corresponding sentences to construct training data. Like TextRunner, WOE's extractor eschews lexicalized features and handles an unbounded set of semantic relations. WOE can operate in two modes: when restricted to POS tag features, it runs as quickly as TextRunner, but when set to use dependency-parse features its precision and recall rise even higher.\\n\",\n",

The main contributions are: i) a method for exploiting generic patterns by filtering incorrect instances using the Web; and ii) a principled measure of pattern and instance reliability enabling the filtering algorithm. We present an empirical comparison of Espresso with various state of the art systems, on different size and genre corpora, on extracting various general and specific relations. Experimental results show that our exploitation of generic patterns substantially increases system recall with small effect on overall precision.\\n',\n",

       "  \"AB This paper describes discriminative language modeling for a large vocabulary speech recognition task. We contrast two parameter estimation methods: the perceptron algorithm, and a method based on maximizing the regularized conditional toe-likelihood. The models are encoded as deterministic weighted finite state automata, and are applied by intersecting the automata with word-lattices that are the output from a baseline recognizer. The perceptron algorithm has the benefit of automatically selecting a relatively small feature set in just a couple of passes over the training data. We describe a method based on regularized likelihood that makes use of the feature set given by the perceptron algorithm, and initialization with the perceptron's weights; this method gives an additional 0.5% reduction in word error rate (WER) over training with the perceptron alone. The final system achieves a 1.8% absolute reduction in WER for a baseline first-pass recognition system (from 39.2% to 37.4%), and a 0.9% absolute reduction in WER for a multi-pass recognition system (from 28.9% to 28.0%).

       "  \"AB Recent work on spoken document retrieval has suggested that it is adequate to take the single-best output of ASR, and perform text retrieval on this output. This is reasonable enough for the task of retrieving broadcast news stories, where word error rates are relatively low, and the stories are long enough to contain much redundancy. But it is patently not reasonable if one's task is to retrieve a short snippet of speech in a domain where WER's can be as high as 50%; such would be the situation with teleconference speech, where one's task is to find if and when a participant uttered a certain phrase. In this paper we propose an indexing procedure for spoken utterance retrieval that works on lattices rather than just single-best text. We demonstrate that this procedure can improve F scores by over five points compared to single-best retrieval on tasks with poor WER and low redundancy. The representation is flexible so that we can represent both word lattices, as well as phone lattices, the latter being important for improving performance when searching for phrases containing OOV words.\\n\",\n",

       "  'AB Most sentiment analysis approaches use as baseline a support vector machines (SVM) classifier with binary unigram weights. In this paper, we explore whether more sophisticated feature weighting schemes from Information Retrieval can enhance classification accuracy. We show that variants of the classic tf.idf scheme adapted to sentiment analysis provide significant increases in accuracy, especially when using a sublinear function for term frequency weights and document frequency smoothing. The techniques are tested on a wide selection of data sets and produce the best accuracy to our knowledge.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB We present an automatic approach to tree annotation in which basic nonterminal symbols are alternately split and merged to maximize the likelihood of a training treebank. Starting with a simple X-bar grammar, we learn a new grammar whose nonterminals are subsymbols of the original nonterminals. In contrast with previous work, we are able to split various terminals to different degrees, as appropriate to the actual complexity in the data. Our grammars automatically learn the kinds of linguistic distinctions exhibited in previous work on manual tree annotation. On the other hand, our grammars are much more compact and substantially more accurate than previous work on automatic annotation. Despite its simplicity, our best grammar achieves an F(1) of 90.2% on the Penn Treebank, higher than fully lexicalized systems.\\n',\n",

The composite kernel consists of two individual kernels: an entity kernel that allows for entity-related features and a convolution parse tree kernel that models syntactic information of relation examples. The motivation of our method is to fully utilize the nice properties of kernel methods to explore diverse knowledge for relation extraction. Our study illustrates that the composite kernel can effectively capture both flat and structured features without the need for extensive feature engineering, and can also easily scale to include more features. Evaluation on the ACE corpus shows that our method outperforms the previous best-reported methods and significantly outperforms previous two dependency tree kernels for relation extraction.\\n',\n",

       "  \"AB We propose a novel algorithm for inducing semantic taxonomies. Previous algorithms for taxonomy induction have typically focused on independent classifiers for discovering new single relationships based on hand-constructed or automatically discovered textual patterns. By contrast, our algorithm flexibly incorporates evidence from multiple classifiers over heterogenous relationships to optimize the entire structure of the taxonomy, using knowledge of a word's coordinate terms to help in determining its hypernyms, and vice versa. We apply our algorithm on the problem of sense-disambiguated noun hyponym acquisition, where we combine the predictions of hypernym and coordinate term classifiers with the knowledge in a preexisting semantic taxonomy (WordNet 2.1). We add 10, 000 novel synsets to WordNet 2.1 at 84% precision, a relative error reduction of 70% over a non-joint algorithm using the same component classifiers. Finally, we show that a taxonomy built using Our algorithm shows a 23% relative F-score improvement over WordNet 2.1 on an independent testset of hypernym pairs.\\n\",\n",

       "  \"AB Natural language processing (NLP) is critical for improvement of the healthcare process because it can encode clinical data in patient documents. Many clinical applications such as decision support require coded data to function appropriately. However, in order to be applicable for healthcare, performance must be adequate. A valuable automated application is the detection of infectious diseases, such as surveillance of pneumonia in newborns (e.g., neonates) because the disease produces significant rates of morbidity and mortality, and manual surveillance is challenging. Studies have demonstrated that automated surveillance using NLP is a useful adjunct to manual surveillance and an effective tool for infection control practitioners. This paper presents a study evaluating the feasibility of an NLP-based monitoring system to screen for healthcare-associated pneumonia in neonates. We estimated sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value by comparing results with clinicians ' judgments. Sensitivity was 71% and specificity was 99%. Our results demonstrated that the automated method was feasible. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\\n\",\n",

       "  'AB We present an information theoretic approach to feature selection when the data possesses feature classes. Feature classes are pervasive in real data. For example, in gene expression data, the genes which serve as features may be divided into classes based on their membership in gene families or pathways. When doing word sense disambiguation or named entity extraction, features fall into classes including adjacent words, their parts of speech, and the topic and venue of the document the word is in. When predictive features occur predominantly in a small number of feature classes, our information theoretic approach significantly improves feature selection. Experiments on real and synthetic data demonstrate substantial improvement in predictive accuracy over the standard L-0 penalty-based stepwise and streamwise feature selection methods as well as over Lasso and Elastic Nets, all of which are oblivious to the existence of feature classes.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB One of the goals of medical research in the area of dementia is to correlate images of the brain with other variables, for instance, demographic information or outcomes of clinical tests. The usual approach is to select a subset of patients based on such variables and analyze the images associated with those patients. In this paper we apply data mining techniques to take the opposite approach: We start with the images and explain the differences and commonalities in terms of the other variables. In the first step, we cluster PET scans of patients to form groups sharing similar features in brain metabolism. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time ever that clustering is applied to whole PET scans. In the second step, we explain the clusters by relating them to non-image variables. To do so, we employ RSD, an algorithm for relational subgroup discovery, with the cluster membership of patients as target variable, Our results enable interesting interpretations of differences in brain metabolism in terms of demographic and clinical variables. The approach was implemented and tested on an exceptionally large pre-existing data collection of patients with different types of dementia. It comprises 10 GB of image data from 454 PET scans, and 42 variables from psychological and demographical data organized in 11 relations of a relational database. We believe that explaining medical images in terms of other variables (patient records, demographic information, etc.) is a challenging new and rewarding area for data mining research.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB There are three factors involved in text classification: the classification model, the similarity measure, and the document representation. In this chapter, we will focus on document representation and demonstrate that the choice of document representation has a profound impact on the quality of the classification. We will also show that the text quality affects the choice of document representation. In our experiments we have used the centroid-based classification, which is a simple and robust text classification scheme. We will compare four different types of document representation: N-grams, single terms, phrases, and a logic-based document representation called RDR. The N-gram representation is a string-based representation with no linguistic processing. The single-term approach is based on words with minimum linguistic processing. The phrase approach is based on linguistically formed phrases and single words. The RDR is based on linguistic processing and representing documents as a set of logical predicates. Our experiments on many text collections yielded similar results. Here, we base our arguments on experiments conducted on Reuters-21578 and contest (ASRS) collection (see Appendix). We show that RDR, the more complex representation, produces more effective classification on Reuters-21578, followed by the phrase approach. However, on the ASRS collection, which contains many syntactic errors (noise), the 5-gram approach outperforms all other methods by 13%. That is because the 5-gram approach is a robust method in presence of noise. The more complex models produce better classification results, but since they are dependent on natural language processing (NLP) techniques, they are vulnerable to noise.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB In this paper, we propose the \"Democratic Classifier\", a simple pattern-bused classification algorithm that uses very short patterns for classification, and does not rely on the minimum support threshold. Borrowing ideas from democracy, our training phase allows each training instance to vote for an equal number of candidate size-2 patterns. The training instances select patterns by effectively balancing between local, class, and global significance of patterns. The selected patterns are simultaneously added to the model for all applicable classes and a novel power law based weighing scheme adjusts their weights with respect of each class.\\n',\n",

On 100 real-lite web datasets, the average absolute classification accuracy improvement was as great as 9.4% over SVM, Harmony, C4.5 and KNN. Also, our algorithm ran about 3.5 times faster than the fastest existing pattern-based classification algorithm.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB Association analysis arises in many important applications such as bioinformatics and business intelligence. Given a large collection of measurements over a set of samples, association analysis aims to find dependencies of target variables to subsets of measurements. Most previous algorithms adopt a two-stage approach; they first group samples based on the similarity in the subset of measurements, and then they examine the association between these groups and the specified target variables without considering the inter-group similarities or alternative groupings. This can lead to cases where the strength of association depends significantly on arbitrary clustering choices.\\n',\n",
       "  '   In this paper we propose a tree-based method for quantitative association analysis. Tree hierarchies derived from sample similarities represent many possible sample groupings. They also provide a natural way to incorporate domain knowledge such as ontologies and to identify and remove outliers. Given a free hierarchy, our association analysis evaluates all possible groupings and selects the one with strongest association to the target variable. We introduce an efficient algorithm, TreeQA, to systematically explore the search-space of all possible groupings in a set of input trees, with integrated permutation tests. Experimental results show that TreeQA is able to handle large-scale association analysis very efficiently and is more effective and robust in association analysis than previous methods.\\n',\n",

       "  \"AB In this paper, we present RBNBC, a Repeat Based Naive Bayes Classifier of bio-sequences that uses maximal frequent subsequences as features. RBNBC's design is based on generic ideas that can apply to other domains where the data is organized as collections of sequences. Specifically, RBNBC uses a novel formulation of Naive Bayes that incorporates repeated occurrences of subsequences within each sequence. Our extensive experiments on two collections of protein families show flint it performs as well as existing state-of-the-art probabilistic classifiers for bio-sequences. This is surprising as it is a pure data mining based generic classifier that does not require domain-specific background knowledge. We note that domain-specific ideas could further increase its performance.\\n\",\n",

       "  'AB Graph mining methods enumerate frequent subgraphs efficiently, but, it is often problematic to summarize the large number of obtained patterns. Thus it makes sense to combine frequent graph mining with principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality and collect a smaller number of characteristic patterns. We present a novel iterative mining algorithm that captures informative patterns corresponding to major entries of top principal components. It repeatedly calls weighted substructure mining where example weights are updated in each iteration. The Lanczos algorithm, a standard algorithm of eigendecomposition, is employed to update the weights. In experiments, our patterns are shown to approximate the principal components obtained by frequent mining.\\n',\n",

In this work, we apply K-nearest-neighbour regression, single layer networks, mixture of experts and Gaussian processes to predict the permeability coefficient. We obtain a considerable improvement oiler the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSARs) predictors. We show that using five features, which are Molecular weight, solubility parameter lipophilicity, the number of hydrogen bonding acceptor and donor groups, can produce better predictions than the one using only lipophilicity and the molecular weight. The Gaussian process regression with five compound features gives the best performance in this work.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB In recent years; privacy preserving data mining has become very important because of the proliferation of large amounts of data on the internet. Many data sets are inherently high dimensional, which are challenging to different privacy preservation algorithms. However, some domains of such data sets also have some special properties which make the use of sketch based techniques particularly useful. In this paper, we present a new method for privacy preserving data mining of text and binary data with the use of a sketch based approach. The special properties of such data sets which are exploited are that of sparsity; according to this property, only a small percentage of the attributes have non-zero values. We formalize an anonymity model for the sketch based approach, and utilize it in order to construct sketch based privacy preserving representations of the original data. This representation allows accurate computation of a number of important data mining primitives such as the clot product. Therefore, it can be used for a variety of data mining algorithms such as clustering and classification. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on a number of real and synthetic data sets. We show that the accuracy of data mining algorithms is preserved by the transformation even in the presence of increasing data dimensionality.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB Performing data-mining tasks such as clustering, classification, and prediction on large datasets is an arduous task and, many times, it is an infeasible task given current hardware limitations. The distributed nature of peer-to-peer databases further complicates this issue by introducing an access overhead cost in addition to the cost of sending individual tuples over the network. We propose a two-level sampling approach focusing on peer-to-peer databases for maximizing sample quality given a user-defined communication budget. Given that individual peers may have varying cardinality we propose an algorithm for determining the optimal sample rate (the percentage of tuples to sample from a peer)for each peer We do this by analyzing the variance of individual peers, ultimately minimizing the total variance of the entire sample. By performing local optimization of individual peer sample rates we maximize approximation accuracy of the samples. We also offer several techniques for sampling in peer-to-peer databases given various amounts of known and unknown information about the network and its peers.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB Monitoring multiple streaming sources for collective decision making presents several challenges. First, streaming data are often of large volume, fast speed, and highly bursty nature. Second, it is impossible to offload classification decisions to individual data sources, each of which lacks full knowledge for the decision making. Hence, the central classifier responsible for decision making may be frequently overloaded. In this paper, we study intelligent load shedding for classifying multi-source data. We aim at maximizing classification quality under resource (CPU and bandwidth) constraints. We use a Markov model to predict the distribution of feature values over time. Then, leveraging Bayesian decision theory, we use Bayes risk analysis to model the variances among different data sources in their contributions to the classification quality. We adopt an Expected Observational Risk criterion to quantify the loss of classification quality due to load shedding, and propose a Best Feature First (BFF) algorithm that greedily minimizes such risk. The effectiveness of the approach proposed is confirmed by experiments.\\n',\n",

In this paper, we present analyses focussing on two important aspects of logistic models its relationship with exponential family based generative models, and its performance in online and potentially adversarial settings. In particular, we present two new theoretical results on logistic models focusing on the above two aspects. First, we establish an exact connection between logistic models and exponential family based generative models, resolving a long-standing ambiguity over their relationship. Second, we show that online Bayesian logistic models are competitive to the best batch models, even in potentially adversarial settings. Further, we discuss relevant connections of our analysis to the literature on integral transforms, and also present a new optimality result for Bayesian models. The analysis makes a strong case for using logistic models and partly explains the success of such models for a wide range of practical problems.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB Decision lists (or ordered rule sets) have two attractive properties compared to unordered rule sets: they require a simpler classification procedure and they allow for a more compact representation. However, it is an open question what effect these properties have on the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Two ways of forming decision lists are considered in this study: by generating a sequence of rules, with a default rule for one of the classes, and by imposing an order upon rules that have been generated for all classes. An empirical investigation shows that the latter method gives a significantly higher AUC than the former, demonstrating that the compactness obtained by using one of the classes as a default is indeed associated with a cost. Furthermore, by using all applicable rules rather than the first in an ordered set, an even further significant improvement in AUC is obtained, demonstrating that the simple classification procedure is also associated with a cost. The observed gains in AUC for unordered rule sets compared to decision lists can be explained by that learning rules for all classes as well as combining multiple rules allow for examples to be ranked according to a more fine-grained scale compared to when applying rules in a fixed order and providing a default rule for one of the classes.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB We consider an l(2)-regularized non-convex optimization problem for recovering signals from their noisy phaseless observations. We design and study the performance of a message passing algorithm that aims to solve this optimization problem. We consider the asymptotic setting m, n -> infinity, m/n -> delta and obtain sharp performance bounds, where m is the number of measurements and n is the signal dimension. We show that for complex signals, the algorithm can perform accurate recovery with only m = ((64/pi(2)) - 4) n approximate to 2.5n measurements. Also, we provide a sharp analysis on the sensitivity of the algorithm to noise. We highlight the following facts about our message passing algorithm: 1) adding l(2) regularization to the non-convex loss function can be beneficial and 2) spectral initialization has a marginal impact on the performance of the algorithm. The sharp analyses, in this paper, not only enable us to compare the performance of our method with other phase recovery schemes but also shed light on designing better iterative algorithms for other non-convex optimization problems.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB Subspace clustering is the problem of partitioning unlabeled data points into a number of clusters so that data points within one cluster lie approximately on a low-dimensional linear subspace. In many practical scenarios, the dimensionality of data points to be clustered is compressed due to the constraints of measurement, computation, or privacy. In this paper, we study the theoretical properties of a popular subspace clustering algorithm named sparse subspace clustering (SSC) and establish formal success conditions of SSC on dimensionality-reduced data. Our analysis applies to the most general fully deterministic model, where both underlying subspaces and data points within each subspace are deterministically positioned, and also a wide range of dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., Gaussian random projection, uniform subsampling, and sketching) that fall into a subspace embedding framework. Finally, we apply our analysis to a differentially private SSC algorithm and established both privacy and utility guarantees of the proposed method.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB PurposeAlthough the life expectancy of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) has increased, little is known of their causes of death (CODs) in the rituximab era.Patients and MethodsWe pooled two cohorts of newly diagnosed patients with FL grade 1-3A. Patients were enrolled between 2001 and 2013 in two French referral institutions (N = 734; median follow-up 89 months) and 2002 and 2012 in the University of Iowa and Mayo Clinic Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE; N = 920; median follow-up 84 months). COD was classified as being a result of lymphoma, other malignancy, treatment related, or all other causes.ResultsTen-year overall survival was comparable in the French (80%) and US (77%) cohorts. We were able to classify COD in 248 (88%) of 283 decedents. In the overall cohort, lymphoma was the most common COD, with a cumulative incidence of 10.3% at 10 years, followed by treatment-related mortality (3.0%), other malignancy (2.9%), other causes (2.2%), and unknown (3.0%). The 10-year cumulative incidence of death as a result of lymphoma or treatment was higher than death as a result of all other causes for each age group (including patients 70 years of age at diagnosis [25.4% v 16.6%]) Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score 3 to 5 (27.4% v 5.2%), but not Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score 0 to 1 (4.0% v 3.7%); for patients who failed to achieve event-free survival within 24 months from diagnosis (36.1% v 7.0%), but not for patients who achieved event-free survival within 24 months of diagnosis (6.7% v 5.7%); and for patients with a history of transformed FL (45.9% v 4.7%), but not among patients without (8.1% v 6.2%). Overall, 77 of 140 deaths as a result of lymphoma occurred in patients whose FL transformed after diagnosis.ConclusionDespite the improvement in overall survival in patients with FL in the rituximab era, their leading COD remains lymphoma, especially after disease transformation. Treatment-related mortality also represents a concern, which supports the need for less-toxic therapies.\\n',\n",

In this paper, we answer the fundamental question of characterizing the level of overall privacy degradation as a function of the number of queries and the privacy levels maintained by each privatization mechanism. Our solution is complete: we prove an upper bound on the overall privacy level and construct a sequence of privatization mechanisms that achieves this bound. The key innovation is the introduction of an operational interpretation of differential privacy (involving hypothesis testing) and the use of a data processing inequality along with its converse. Our result improves over the state of the art, and has immediate connections to several problems studied in the literature.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB Although a large body of work is devoted to finding communities in static social networks, only a few studies examined the dynamics of communities in evolving social networks. In this paper, we propose a dynamic stochastic block model for finding communities and their evolution in a dynamic social network. The proposed model captures the evolution of communities by explicitly modeling the transition of community memberships for individual nodes in the network. Unlike many existing approaches for modeling social networks that estimate parameters by their most likely values (i.e., point estimation), in this study, we employ a Bayesian treatment for parameter estimation that computes the posterior distributions for all the unknown parameters. This Bayesian treatment allows us to capture the uncertainty in parameter values and therefore is more robust to data noise than point estimation. In addition, an efficient algorithm is developed for Bayesian inference to handle large sparse social networks. Extensive experimental studies based on both synthetic data and real-life data demonstrate that our model achieves higher accuracy and reveals more insights in the data than several state-of-the-art algorithms.\\n',\n",

       "  \"AB The learning of trust and distrust is a crucial aspect of social interaction among autonomous, mentally-opaque agents. In this work, we address the learning of trust based on past observations and context information. We argue that from the truster's point of view trust is best expressed as one of several relations that exist between the agent to be trusted (trustee) and the state of the environment. Besides attributes expressing trustworthiness, additional relations might describe commitments made by the trustee with regard to the current situation, like: a seller offers a certain price for a specific product. We show how to implement and learn context-sensitive trust using statistical relational learning in form of a Dirichlet process mixture model called Infinite Hidden Relational Trust Model (IHRTM). The practicability and effectiveness of our approach is evaluated empirically on user-ratings gathered from eBay. Our results suggest that (i) the inherent clustering achieved in the algorithm allows the truster to characterize the structure of a trust-situation and provides meaningful trust assessments; (ii) utilizing the collaborative filtering effect associated with relational data does improve trust assessment performance; (iii) by learning faster and transferring knowledge more effectively we improve cold start performance and can cope better with dynamic behavior in open multiagent systems. The later is demonstrated with interactions recorded from a strategic two-player negotiation scenario.\\n\",\n",

       "  'AB In this paper, we present a topic level expertise search framework for heterogeneous networks. Different from the traditional Web search engines that perform retrieval and ranking at document level (or at object level), we investigate the problem of expertise search at topic level over heterogeneous networks. In particular, we study this problem in an academic search and mining system, which extracts and integrates the academic data from the distributed Web. We present a unified topic model to simultaneously model topical aspects of different objects in the academic network. Based on the learned topic models, we investigate the expertise search problem from three dimensions: ranking, citation tracing analysis, and topical graph search. Specifically, we propose a topic level random walk method for ranking the different objects. In citation tracing analysis, we aim to uncover how a piece of work influences its follow-up work. Finally, we have developed a topical graph search function, based on the topic modeling and citation tracing analysis. Experimental results show that various expertise search and mining tasks can indeed benefit from the proposed topic level analysis approach.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB One of the goals of artificial intelligence is to develop agents that learn and act in complex environments. Realistic environments typically feature a variable number of objects, relations amongst them, and non-deterministic transition behavior. While standard probabilistic sequence models provide efficient inference and learning techniques for sequential data, they typically cannot fully capture the relational complexity. On the other hand, statistical relational learning techniques are often too inefficient to cope with complex sequential data. In this paper, we introduce a simple model that occupies an intermediate position in this expressiveness/efficiency trade-off. It is based on CP-logic (Causal Probabilistic Logic), an expressive probabilistic logic for modeling causality. However, by specializing CP-logic to represent a probability distribution over sequences of relational state descriptions and employing a Markov assumption, inference and learning become more tractable and effective. Specifically, we show how to solve part of the inference and learning problems directly at the first-order level, while transforming the remaining part into the problem of computing all satisfying assignments for a Boolean formula in a binary decision diagram.

       "  'AB The output of frequent pattern mining is a huge number of frequent patterns, which are very redundant, causing a serious problem in understandability. We focus on mining frequent subgraphs for which well-considered approaches to reduce the redundancy are limited because of the complex nature of graphs. Two known, standard solutions are closed and maximal frequent subgraphs, but closed frequent subgraphs are still redundant and maximal frequent subgraphs are too specific. A more promising solution is delta-tolerance closed frequent subgraphs, which decrease monotonically in delta, being equal to maximal frequent subgraphs and closed frequent subgraphs for delta = 0 and 1, respectively. However, the current algorithm for mining d-tolerance closed frequent subgraphs is a naive, two-step approach in which frequent subgraphs are all enumerated and then sifted according to delta-tolerance closedness. We propose an efficient algorithm based on the idea of \"reverse-search\" by which the completeness of enumeration is guaranteed and for which new pruning conditions are incorporated. We empirically demonstrate that our approach significantly reduced the amount of real computation time of two compared algorithms for mining delta-tolerance closed frequent subgraphs, being pronounced more for practical settings.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB The analysis of n-ary relations receives attention in many different fields, for instance biology, web mining, and social studies. In the basic setting, there are n sets of instances, and each observation associates n instances, one from each set. A common approach to explore these n-way data is the search for n-set patterns, the n-way equivalent of itemsets. More precisely, an n-set pattern consists of specific subsets of the n instance sets such that all possible associations between the corresponding instances are observed in the data. In contrast, traditional itemset mining approaches consider only two-way data, namely items versus transactions. The n-set patterns provide a higher-level view of the data, revealing associative relationships between groups of instances. Here, we generalize this approach in two respects. First, we tolerate missing observations to a certain degree, that means we are also interested in n-sets where most (although not all) of the possible associations have been recorded in the data. Second, we take association weights into account. In fact, we propose a method to enumerate all n-sets that satisfy a minimum threshold with respect to the average association weight. Technically, we solve the enumeration task using a reverse search strategy, which allows for effective pruning of the search space. In addition, our algorithm provides a ranking of the solutions and can consider further constraints. We show experimental results on artificial and real-world datasets from different domains.\\n',\n",

       "  \"AB Hybrid pattern recognition was put forward to discriminate paddy seeds of four different storage periods based on visible/near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (Vis/NIRS). The hybrid pattern recognition included extracting feature and building classifier. A total of 210 samples of paddy seeds, which belonged to four classes, were used for collecting Vis/NIR spectra (3251075 nm) using a field spectroradiometer. The hybrid pattern recognition was integrated with wavelet transform (WT), principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) models. WT was used to eliminate noises and extract characteristic information from spectral data. The characteristic information could be visualized in principal components (PCs) space, in which the structures correlative with the storage periods could be discovered. The first eight PCs, which accounted for 99.94% of the raw spectral data variance, were used as input of the ANN mode, and the model yielded high discrimination accuracy rates of 100%, 100%, 100% and 90% for four classes' samples respectively.\\n\",\n",

The detailed analysis process about this method has been shown, and anti-jamming designs were done for the approximate step-wise disturbance which appeared in the system, to gain the optimal control parameter the fuzzy neural network is used in the method. Simulations are performed to validate the scheme for initial alignment, obtained the same precision to other alignment method. And the most splendid was that the using of the LQ optimal control reduces the alignment time consumedly, much more quickly than other traditional method. What is discovered in the simulation is while the initial error angles were smaller than 10 degrees; error angle will converge to quite good precision in several seconds.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB The embedded linear transformation is a popular technique which integrates both transformation and diagonal-covariance Gaussian mixture into a unified framework to improve the performance of speaker recognition. However, the mixture number of GMM must be given in model training. The cluster expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is a well-known technique in which the mixture number is regarded as an estimated parameter. This paper presents a new model that integrates an improved cluster algorithm into the estimating process of GMM with the embedded transformation. In the approach, the transformation matrix, the mixture number and other traditional model parameters are simultaneously estimated according to a maximum likelihood criterion. The proposed method is demonstrated on a database of three data sessions for text independent speaker identification. The experiments show that this method outperforms the traditional GMM with cluster EM algorithm.\\n',\n",

       "  \"AB In this paper front bilinear pairings, we propose two ID-based signatures without trusted PKG, which solve the key escrow problem. In the schemes, the PKG is prevented forging a legal user's signature for its traceability. Under random oracle model, our schemes are both proved secure against existential forgery on adaptively chosen message and ID attack, assuming the Computational Diffie-Hellman Problem (CDHP) in Diffie-Hellman group is intractable. By comparison, our schemes have higher efficiency than the existing schemes.\\n\",\n",

       "  'AB The exploding growth of the biomedical literature presents many challenges for biological researchers. One such challenge is from the use of a great deal of abbreviations. Extracting abbreviations and their definitions accurately is very helpful to biologists and also facilitates biomedical text analysis. Among existing approaches, text alignment algorithms are simple, effective and require no training data. However state of the art alignment algorithms could not identify the definitions of irregular abbreviations (e.g., < CNS1, cyclophilin seven suppressor>). We propose an algorithm analogous to pairwise sequence alignment, in which it is given a penalty score if there are two unmatched characters separately from the abbreviation and definition, and in this way some irregular abbreviations are found.\\n',\n",

With a little more memory overhead, proposed pruning strategies can prune invalidated search space and decrease the total cost of frequency counting effectively. For effectiveness testing reason, we optimize SPAM [2] and present the improved algorithm, SPAM(SEPIEP), which uses SEP and IEP to prune the search space by sharing the frequent 2-sequences lists. A set of comprehensive performance experiments study shows that SPAM(SEPIEP) outperforms SPAM by a factor of 10 on small datasets and better than 30% to 50% on reasonably large dataset.\\n',\n",

The purpose of the paper is to find an optimum affection factor that may not only reflect nature characteristic of clustering data sample, but also reduce influence caused by sample deviation to minimum. In this paper, an affection interval concept is defined at first. Then an optimum objective function for reducing influence of sample deviation is constructed and an approximate solution is given of optimum affection factor. In the end, a standard data set offered in the MATLAB is used to test the availability of the optimum affection factor, the result is satisfactory.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB While null space based linear discriminant analysis (NLDA) obtains a good discriminant performance, the ability easily suffers from an implicit assumption of Gaussian model with same covariance each class. Meanwhile, mixture model discriminant analysis, which is a good way for processing issues on multiple subclasses in each class, depends on human experience on the number of subclasses and has a highly complex iterative process. Considering the cons and pros of the two mentioned approaches, we therefore propose a new algorithm, called Spectral clustering based Null space Linear Discriminant Analysis (SNLDA). The main contributions of the algorithm include the following three aspects: 1) Employing a new spectral clustering method which can automatically detect the number of clusters in each class. 2) Finding a unified null space for processing multi-subclasses issues with eigen-solution technique. 3) Refining the calculation of the covariance matrix in a single sample subclass. The experimental results show the promising of the proposed SNLDA algorithm.\\n',\n",

Based on the research of related works, the optimization principle of restart tree is analyzed and a novel approach is proposed for optimizing restart tree. In this approach, mean failure frequencies of components are obtained by injecting exceptions during load testing, which could be used to compute and analyze the failure correlation degrees between components. The components with high failure correlation degrees are constructed as a restart group to realize the optimization of restart tree. The results of the case study show that this approach reduces the mean time to recovery of componentized distributed application and implements the optimization of restart tree.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB Crowding is a visual effect suffered by humans, in which an object that can be recognized in isolation can no longer be recognized when other objects, called flankers, are placed close to it. In this work, we study the effect of crowding in artificial Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for object recognition. We analyze both deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as well as an extension of DCNNs that are multi-scale and that change the receptive field size of the convolution filters with their position in the image. The latter networks, that we call eccentricity-dependent, have been proposed for modeling the feedforward path of the primate visual cortex. Our results reveal that the eccentricity-dependent model, trained on target objects in isolation, can recognize such targets in the presence of flankers, if the targets are near the center of the image, whereas DCNNs cannot. Also, for all tested networks, when trained on targets in isolation, we find that recognition accuracy of the networks decreases the closer the flankers are to the target and the more flankers there are. We find that visual similarity between the target and flankers also plays a role and that pooling in early layers of the network leads to more crowding. Additionally, we show that incorporating flankers into the images of the training set for learning the DNNs does not lead to robustness against configurations not seen at training.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB Conditional probabilities are a core concept in machine learning. For example, optimal prediction of a label Y given an input X corresponds to maximizing the conditional probability of Y given X . A common approach to inference tasks is learning a model of conditional probabilities. However, these models are often based on strong assumptions (e.g., log-linear models), and hence their estimate of conditional probabilities is not robust and is highly dependent on the validity of their assumptions.\\n',\n",
       "  '   Here we propose a framework for reasoning about conditional probabilities without assuming anything about the underlying distributions, except knowledge of their second order marginals, which can be estimated from data. We show how this setting leads to guaranteed bounds on conditional probabilities, which can be calculated efficiently in a variety of settings, including structured-prediction. Finally, we apply them to semi-supervised deep learning, obtaining results competitive with variational autoencoders.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB We analyze the dynamics of an online algorithm for independent component analysis in the high-dimensional scaling limit As the ambient dimension tends to infinity, and with proper time scaling, we show that the time-varying joint empirical measure of the target feature vector and the estimates provided by the algorithm will converge weakly to a deterministic measured-valued process that can be characterized as the unique solution of a nonlinear PDE. Numerical solutions of this PDE, which involves two spatial variables and one time variable, can be efficiently obtained. These solutions provide detailed information about the performance of the ICA algorithm, as many practical performance metrics are functionals of the joint empirical measures. Numerical simulations show that our asymptotic analysis is accurate even for moderate dimensions. In addition to providing a tool for understanding the performance of the algorithm, our PDE analysis also provides useful insight. In particular, in the high-dimensional limit, the original coupled dynamics associated with the algorithm will be asymptotically \"decoupled\", with each coordinate independently solving a 1-D effective minimization problem via stochastic gradient descent. Exploiting this insight to design new algorithms for achieving optimal trade-offs between computational and statistical efficiency may prove an interesting line of future research.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB In this paper we study the differentially private Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) problem in different settings. For smooth (strongly) convex loss function with or without (non)-smooth regularization, we give algorithms that achieve either optimal or near optimal utility bounds with less gradient complexity compared with previous work. For ERM with smooth convex loss function in high-dimensional (p >> n) setting, we give an algorithm which achieves the upper bound with less gradient complexity than previous ones. At last, we generalize the expected excess empirical risk from convex loss functions to non-convex ones satisfying the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition and give a tighter upper bound on the utility than the one in [34].\\n',\n",

       "  'AB Optical Character Recognition (OCR) aims to recognize text in natural images. Inspired by a recently proposed model for general image classification, Recurrent Convolution Neural Network (RCNN), we propose a new architecture named Gated RCNN (GRCNN) for solving this problem. Its critical component, Gated Recurrent Convolution Layer (GRCL), is constructed by adding a gate to the Recurrent Convolution Layer (RCL), the critical component of RCNN. The gate controls the context modulation in RCL and balances the feed-forward information and the recurrent information. In addition, an efficient Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) is built for sequence modeling. The GRCNN is combined with BLSTM to recognize text in natural images. The entire GRCNN-BLSTM model can be trained end-to-end. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods on several benchmark datasets including the IIIT-5K, Street View Text (SVT) and ICDAR.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB This paper explores image caption generation using conditional variational auto-encoders (CVAEs). Standard CVAEs with a fixed Gaussian prior yield descriptions with too little variability. Instead, we propose two models that explicitly structure the latent space around K components corresponding to different types of image content, and combine components to create priors for images that contain multiple types of content simultaneously (e.g., several kinds of objects). Our first model uses a Gaussian Mixture model (GMM) prior, while the second one defines a novel Additive Gaussian (AG) prior that linearly combines component means. We show that both models produce captions that are more diverse and more accurate than a strong LSTM baseline or a \"vanilla\" CVAE with a fixed Gaussian prior, with AG-CVAE showing particular promise.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB We study combinatorial multi-armed bandit with probabilistically triggered arms and semi-bandit feedback (CMAB-T). We resolve a serious issue in the prior CMAB-T studies where the regret bounds contain a possibly exponentially large factor of 1/p* where p* is the minimum positive probability that an arm is triggered by any action. We address this issue by introducing a triggering probability modulated (TPM) bounded smoothness condition into the general CMAB-T framework, and show that many applications such as influence maximization bandit and combinatorial cascading bandit satisfy this TPM condition. As a result, we completely remove the factor of 1/p* from the regret bounds, achieving significantly better regret bounds for influence maximization and cascading bandits than before. Finally, we provide lower bound results showing that the factor 1/p* is unavoidable for general CMAB-T problems, suggesting that the TPM condition is crucial in removing this factor.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB It is well known that, for a linear program (LP) with constraint matrix A is an element of R-mxn, the Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier converges globally and linearly at a rate O((parallel to A parallel to(2)(F) + mn) log(1/epsilon)). However, such a rate is related to the problem dimension and the algorithm exhibits a slow and fluctuating \"tail convergence\" in practice. In this paper, we propose a new variable splitting method of LP and prove that our method has a convergence rate of O(parallel to A parallel to(2) log(1/epsilon)). The proof is based on simultaneously estimating the distance from a pair of primal dual iterates to the optimal primal and dual solution set by certain residuals. In practice, we result in a new first-order LP solver that can exploit both the sparsity and the specific structure of matrix A and a significant speedup for important problems such as basis pursuit, inverse covariance matrix estimation, L1 SVM and nonnegative matrix factorization problem compared with the current fastest LP solvers.\\n',\n",

       "  \"AB Linear regression models have been successfully used to function estimation and model selection in high-dimensional data analysis. However, most existing methods are built on least squares with the mean square error (MSE) criterion, which are sensitive to outliers and their performance may be degraded for heavy-tailed noise. In this paper, we go beyond this criterion by investigating the regularized modal regression from a statistical learning viewpoint. A new regularized modal regression model is proposed for estimation and variable selection, which is robust to outliers, heavy-tailed noise, and skewed noise. On the theoretical side, we establish the approximation estimate for learning the conditional mode function, the sparsity analysis for variable selection, and the robustness characterization. On the application side, we applied our model to successfully improve the cognitive impairment prediction using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort data.\\n\",\n",

       "  'AB Point processes are powerful tools to model user activities and have a plethora of applications in social sciences. Predicting user activities based on point processes is a central problem. However, existing works are mostly problem specific, use heuristics, or simplify the stochastic nature of point processes. In this paper, we propose a framework that provides an efficient estimator of the probability mass function of point processes. In particular, we design a key reformulation of the prediction problem, and further derive a differential-difference equation to compute a conditional probability mass function. Our framework is applicable to general point processes and prediction tasks, and achieves superb predictive and efficiency performance in diverse real-world applications compared to the state of the art.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB We describe an approach to learning from long-tailed, imbalanced datasets that are prevalent in real-world settings. Here, the challenge is to learn accurate \"few-shot\" models for classes in the tail of the class distribution, for which little data is available. We cast this problem as transfer learning, where knowledge from the data-rich classes in the head of the distribution is transferred to the data-poor classes in the tail. Our key insights are as follows. First, we propose to transfer meta-knowledge about learning-to-learn from the head classes. This knowledge is encoded with a meta-network that operates on the space of model parameters, that is trained to predict many-shot model parameters from few-shot model parameters. Second, we transfer this meta-knowledge in a progressive manner, from classes in the head to the \"body\", and from the \"body\" to the tail. That is, we transfer knowledge in a gradual fashion, regularizing meta-networks for few-shot regression with those trained with more training data. This allows our final network to capture a notion of model dynamics, that predicts how model parameters are likely to change as more training data is gradually added. We demonstrate results on image classification datasets (SUN, Places, and ImageNet) tuned for the long-tailed setting, that significantly outperform common heuristics, such as data resampling or reweighting.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB As the amount of textual data has been rapidly increasing over the past decade, efficient similarity search methods have become a crucial component of large-scale information retrieval systems. A popular strategy is to represent original data samples by compact binary codes through hashing. A spectrum of machine learning methods have been utilized, but they often lack expressiveness and flexibility in modeling to learn effective representations. The recent advances of deep learning in a wide range of applications has demonstrated its capability to learn robust and powerful feature representations for complex data. Especially, deep generative models naturally combine the expressiveness of probabilistic generative models with the high capacity of deep neural networks, which is very suitable for text modeling. However, little work has leveraged the recent progress in deep learning for text hashing. In this paper, we propose a series of novel deep document generative models for text hashing. The first proposed model is unsupervised while the second one is supervised by utilizing document labels/tags for hashing. The third model further considers document-specific factors that affect the generation of words. The probabilistic generative formulation of the proposed models provides a principled framework for model extension, uncertainty estimation, simulation, and interpretability. Based on variational inference and reparameterization, the proposed models can be interpreted as encoder-decoder deep neural networks and thus they are capable of learning complex nonlinear distributed representations of the original documents. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on four public testbeds. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed supervised learning models for text hashing.\\n',\n",

In this paper, we study how to exploit diverse relations in an EBSN as well as individual history preferences to recommend preferred events. We first construct a hybrid graph consisting of different types of nodes to represent available entities in an EBSN. The graph uses explicit relations as edges to connect nodes of different types; while transferring implicit relations of event attributes to interconnect the event nodes. After executing the graph random walking, we obtain the candidate events with high convergency probabilities. We next extract a user preference from his attended events to further compute his interest similarities to his candidate events. The recommended event list is then obtained by combining the two similarity scores. Data sets from a real EBSN are used to examine the proposed scheme, and experiment results validate its superiority over peer schemes.\\n',\n",

       "  \"AB Mobile search engine result pages (SERPs) are becoming highly visual and heterogenous. Unlike the traditional ten-blue-link SERPs for desktop search, different verticals and cards occupy different amounts of space within the small screen. Hence, traditional retrieval measures that regard the SERP as a ranked list of homogeneous items are not adequate for evaluating the overall quality of mobile SERPs. Specifically, we address the following new problems in mobile search evaluation: (1) Different retrieved items have different heights within the scrollable SERP, unlike a ten-blue-link SERP in which results have similar heights with each other. Therefore, the traditional rank-based decaying functions are not adequate for mobile search metrics. (2) For some types of verticals and cards, the information that the user seeks is already embedded in the snippet, which makes clicking on those items to access the landing page unnecessary. (3) For some results with complex sub-components (and usually a large height), the total gain of the results cannot be obtained if users only read part of their contents. The benefit brought by the result is affected by user's reading behavior and the internal gain distribution (over the height) should be modeled to get a more accurate estimation. To tackle these problems, we conduct a lab-based user study to construct suitable user behavior model for mobile search evaluation. From the results, we find that the geometric heights of user's browsing trails can be adopted as a good signal of user effort. Based on these findings, we propose a new evaluation metric, Height-Biased Gain, which is calculated by summing up the product of gain distribution and discount factors that are both modeled in terms of result height. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed metric, we compare the agreement of evaluation metrics with side-by-side user preferences on a test collection composed of four mobile search engines. Experimental results show that HBG agrees with user preferences 85.33% of the time, which is better than all existing metrics.\\n\",\n",

       "  'AB QUery processing is one of the main bottlenecks in large-scale search engines. Retrieving the top k most relevant documents for a given query can be extremely expensive, as it involves scoring large amounts of documents. Several dynamic pruning techniques have been introduced in the literature to tackle this problem, such as BlockMaxWAND, which splits the inverted index into constant-sized blocks and stores the maximum document-term scores per block; this information can be used during query execution to safely skip low-score documents, producing many-fold speedups over exhaustive methods.\\n',\n",
       "  '   We introduce a refinement for BlockMaxWANDthat uses variable-sized blocks, rather than constant-sized. We set up the problem of deciding the block partitioning as an optimization problem which maximizes how accurately the block upper bounds represent the underlying scores, and describe an effcient algorithm to find an approximate solution, with provable approximation guarantees. Through an extensive experimental analysis we show that our method significantly outperforms the state of the art roughly by a factor 2 x. We also introduce a compressed data structure to represent the additional block information, providing a compression ratio of roughly 50%, while incurring only a small speed degradation, no more than 10% with respect to its uncompressed counterpart.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB In competitive search settings as the Web, there is an ongoing ranking competition between document authors (publishers) for certain queries. The goal is to have documents highly ranked, and the means is document manipulation applied in response to rankings. Existing retrieval models, and their theoretical underpinnings (e.g., the probability ranking principle), do not account for post-ranking corpus dynamics driven by this strategic behavior of publishers. However, the dynamics has major effect on retrieval effectiveness since it affects content availability in the corpus. Furthermore, while manipulation strategies observed over the Web were reported in past literature, they were not analyzed as ongoing, and changing, post-ranking response strategies, nor were they connected to the foundations of classical ad hoc retrieval models (e.g., content-based document-query surface level similarities and document relevance priors). We present a novel theoretical and empirical analysis of the strategic behavior of publishers using these foundations. Empirical analysis of controlled ranking competitions that we organized reveals a key strategy of publishers: making their documents (gradually) become similar to documents ranked the highest in previous rankings. Our theoretical analysis of the ranking competition as a repeated game, and its minmax regret equilibrium, yields a result that supports the merits of this publishing strategy. We further show that it can be predicted with high accuracy, and without explicit knowledge of the ranking function, whether documents will be promoted to the highest rank in our competitions. The prediction utilizes very few features which quantify changes of documents, specifically with respect to those previously ranked the highest.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB Conversation systems are of growing importance since they enable an easy interaction interface between humans and computers: using natural languages. To build a conversation system with adequate intelligence is challenging, and requires abundant resources including an acquisition of big data and interdisciplinary techniques, such as information retrieval and natural language processing. Along with the prosperity of Web 2.0, the massive data available greatly facilitate data-driven methods such as deep learning for human-computer conversation systems. Owing to the diversity of Web resources, a retrieval-based conversation system will come up with at least some results from the immense repository for any user inputs. Given a human issued message, i.e., query, a traditional conversation system would provide a response after adequate training and learning of how to respond. In this paper, we propose a new task for conversation systems: joint learning of response ranking featured with next utterance suggestion. We assume that the new conversation mode is more proactive and keeps user engaging. We examine the assumption in experiments. Besides, to address the joint learning task, we propose a novel Dual-LSTM Chain Model to couple response ranking and next utterance suggestion simultaneously. From the experimental results, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed task and the effectiveness of the proposed model.\\n',\n",

       "  \"AB Recently, online social networks are becoming increasingly popular platforms for social interactions. Understanding how information propagates in such networks is important for personalization and recommendation in social search. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchicalvel Ittfor'nation Diffusion (FICID) model to capture the informal'.ou diffusion process in social networks. We introduce the notion of users' topic popularity as to enable our model to depict the information diffusion process which is both topic-aware (which topic the information is concerned with) and source-aware (where the information conies from). Instead of assuming homogeneity of social communities, we propose the notion of community hierarchy, where itiformation diffusion across inter-level communities is uni-directional from the higher levels to the lower ones. We design a Gibbs sampling algorithm to infer model parameters and propose prediction methods for two intOnnation diffusion prediction tasks, the re tweet prediction and the cascade prediction. Comparison experiments are conducted on two real datasets. Results show that our model achieves substantial improvement compared with the existing work.\\n\",\n",

       "  'AB Information Retrieval (IR) research has traditionally focused on serving the best results for a single query so-called ad hoc retrieval. However, users typically search iteratively, refining and reformulating their queries during a session. A key challenge in the study of this interaction is the creation of suitable evaluation resources to assess the effectiveness of IR systems over sessions. This paper describes the TREC Session Track, which ran from 2010 through to 2014, which focussed on forming test collections that included various forms of implicit feedback. We describe the test collections; a brief analysis of the differences between datasets over the years; and the evaluation results that demonstrate that the use of user session data significantly improved effectiveness.\\n',\n",

Towards the goal, a novel Dual-Layer Music Preference Topic Model (DL-MPTM) is proposed to construct latent music interest space and characterize the correlations among (user, song, term). Based on the DL-MPTM, we further develop an effective personalized music retrieval system. To evaluate the system's performance, extensive experimental studies have been conducted over two test collections to compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art music retrieval methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms those approaches in terms of personalized search accuracy.\\n\",\n",

Existing methods work well when aspect-opinion pairs can be accurately extracted from review texts and aspect ratings are complete. The challenges of improving prediction accuracy are how to capture the semantics of review content and how to fill in the missing values of aspect ratings. In this paper, we propose a novel review rating prediction method, which improves the prediction accuracy by capturing deep semantics of review content and alleviating data missing problem of aspect ratings. The method firstly learns the latent vector representation of review content using skip-thought vectors, a state-of-the-art deep learning method, then, the missing values of aspect ratings are filled in based on users' history reviewing behaviors, finally, a novel optimization framework is proposed to predict the review rating. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.\\n\",\n",

       "  'AB Mining frequent patterns in transaction databases, time-series databases, and many other kinds of databases has been studied popularly in data mining research. Most of the previous studies adopt an Apriori-like candidate set generation-and-test approach. However, candidate set generation is still costly, especially when there exist prolific patterns and/or long patterns.\\n',\n",
       "  '   In this study, we propose a novel frequent pattern tree (FP-tree) structure, which is an extended prefix-tree structure for storing compressed, crucial information about frequent patterns, and develop an efficient FP-tree-based mining method, FP-growth, for mining the complete set of frequent patterns by pattern fragment growth. Efficiency of mining is achieved with three techniques: (1) a large database is compressed into a highly condensed, much smaller data structure, which avoids costly, repeated database scans, (2) our FP-tree-based mining adopts a pattern fragment growth method to avoid the costly generation of a large number of candidate sets, and (3) a partitioning-based, divide-and-conquer method is used to decompose the mining task into a set of smaller tasks for mining confined patterns in conditional databases, which dramatically reduces the search space. Our performance study shows that the FP-growth method is efficient and scalable for mining both long and short frequent patterns, and is about an order of magnitude faster than the Apriori algorithm and also faster than some recently reported new frequent pattern mining methods.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB For many KDD applications, such as detecting criminal activities in E-commerce, finding the rare instances or the outliers, can. be more interesting than finding the common patterns. Existing work in outlier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a degree of being an outlier. This degree is called the local outlier factor (LOF) of an object. It is local in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding local outliers can be practical.\\n',\n",

Since the primary task in data mining is the development of models about aggregated data, can we develop accurate models without access to precise information in individual data records? We consider the concrete case of building a decision-tree classifier from training data in which the values of individual records have been perturbed. The resulting data records look very different from the original records and the distribution of data values is also very different from the original distribution. While it is not possible to accurately estimate original values in individual data records, we propose a novel reconstruction procedure to accurately estimate the distribution of original data values. By using these reconstructed distributions, we are able to build classifiers whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of classifiers built with the original data.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB In this paper, we propose a novel formulation for distance-based outliers that is based on the distance of a point from its k(th) nearest neighbor. We rank each point on the basis of its distance to its k(th) nearest neighbor and declare the top n points in this ranking to be outliers. In addition to developing relatively straightforward solutions to finding such outliers based on the classical nested-loop join and index join algorithms, we develop a highly efficient partition-based algorithm for mining outliers. This algorithm first partitions the input data set into disjoint subsets, and then prunes entire partitions as soon as it is determined that they cannot contain outliers. This results in substantial savings in computation. We present the results of an extensive experimental study on real-life and synthetic data sets. The results from a real-life NEA database highlight and reveal several expected and unexpected aspects of the database. The results from a study on synthetic data sets demonstrate that the partition-based algorithm scales well with respect to both data set size and data set dimensionality.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB The outlier detection problem has important applications in the field of fraud detection, network robustness analysis, and intrusion detection. Most such applications are high dimensional domains in which the data can contain hundreds of dimensions. Many recent algorithms use concepts of proximity in order to find outliers based on their relationship to the rest of the data. However, in high dimensional space, the data is sparse and the notion of proximity fails to retain its meaningfulness. In fact, the sparsity of high dimensional data implies that every point is an almost equally good outlier from the perspective of proximity-based definitions. Consequently, for high dimensional data, the notion of finding meaningful outliers becomes substantially more complex and non-obvious. In this paper, we discuss new techniques for outlier detection which find the outliers by studying the behavior of projections from the data set.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB Similarity search in large time series databases has attracted much research interest recently. ft is a difficult problem because of the typically high dimensionality of the data.. The most promising solutions involve performing dimensionality reduction on the data, then indexing the reduced data with a multidimensional index structure. Many dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed, including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). In this work we introduce a new dimensionality reduction technique which we call Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA). While previous techniques (e.g., SVD, DFT and DWT) choose a common representation for all the items in the database that minimizes the global reconstruction error, APCA approximates each time series by a set of constant value segments of varying lengths such that their individual reconstruction errors are minimal. We show how APCA can be indexed using a multidimensional index structure. We propose two distance measures in the indexed space that exploit the high fidelity of APCA for fast searching: a lower bounding Euclidean distance approximation, and a non-lower bounding, but very tight Euclidean distance approximation and show how they can support fast exact searching, and even faster approximate searching on the same index structure. We theoretically and empirically compare APCA to all the other techniques and demonstrate its superiority.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB The coming years will witness dramatic advances in wireless communications as well as positioning technologies. As a result, tracking the changing positions of objects capable of continuous movement is becoming increasingly feasible and necessary. The present paper proposes a novel, R*-tree based indexing technique that supports the efficient querying of the current and projected future positions of such moving objects. The technique is capable of indexing objects moving in one-, two-, and three-dimensional space. Update algorithms enable the index to accommodate a dynamic data set, where objects may appear and disappear, and where changes occur in the anticipated positions of existing objects. A comprehensive performance study is reported.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB Inherent in the operation of many decision support and continuous referral systems is the notion of the \" influence\" of a data point on the database. This notion arises in examples such as finding the set of customers affected by the opening of a new store outlet location, notifying the subset of subscribers to a digital library who will find a newly added document most relevant, etc. Standard approaches to determining the influence set of a data point involve range searching and nearest neighbor queries.\\n',\n",
       "  '   In this paper, we formalize a novel notion of influence based on reverse neighbor queries and its variants. Since the nearest neighbor relation is not symmetric, the set of points that are closest to a query point (i.e., the nearest neighbors) differs from the set of points that have the query point as their nearest neighbor (called the reverse nearest neighbors). Influence sets based on reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) queries seem to capture the intuitive notion of influence from our motivating examples.\\n',\n",
       "  '   We present a general approach for solving RNN queries and an efficient R-tree based method for large data sets, based on this approach. Although the RNN query appears to be natural, it has not been studied previously. RNN queries are of independent interest, and as such should be part of the suite of available queries for processing spatial and multimedia data. In our experiments with real geographical data, the proposed method appears to scale logarithmically, whereas straightforward sequential scan scales linearly. Our experimental study also shows that approaches based on range searching or nearest neighbors are ineffective at finding influence sets of our interest.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB In large federated and shared-nothing databases, resources can exhibit widely fluctuating characteristics. Assumptions made at the time a query is Submitted will rarely hold throughout the duration of query processing. As a result, traditional static query optimization and execution techniques are ineffective in these environments.\\n',\n",
       "  '   In this paper we introduce a query processing mechanism called an eddy, which continuously reorders operators in a query plan as it runs. We characterize the moments of symmetry during which pipelined joins can be easily reordered, and the synchronization barriers that require inputs from different sources to be coordinated. By combining eddies with appropriate join algorithms, we merge the optimization and execution phases of query processing, allowing each tuple to have a flexible ordering of the query operators. This flexibility is controlled by a combination of fluid dynamics and a simple learning algorithm. Our initial implementation demonstrates promising results, with eddies performing nearly as well as a static optimizer/executor in static scenarios,;and providing dramatic improvements in dynamic execution environments.\\n',\n",

       "  'AB High dimensional data has always been a challenge for clustering algorithms because of the inherent sparsity of the points. Recent research results indicate that in high dimensional data, even the concept of proximity or clustering may not be meaningful. We discuss very general techniques for projected clustering which are able to construct clusters in arbitrarily aligned subspaces of lower dimensionality. The subspaces are specific to the clusters themselves. This definition is substantially more general and realistic than currently available techniques which limit the method to only projections from the original set of attributes. The generalized projected clustering technique may also be viewed as a way of trying to redefine clustering for high dimensional applications by searching for hidden subspaces with clusters which are created by inter-attribute correlations. We provide a new concept of using extended cluster feature vectors in order to make the algorithm scalable for very large databases. The running time and space requirements of the algorithm are adjustable, and are likely to tradeoff with better accuracy.\\n',\n",

       "  \"AB Continuous queries are persistent queries that allow users to receive new results when they become available. While continuous query systems can transform a passive web into an active environment, they need to be able to support millions of queries due to the scale of the Internet. No existing systems have achieved this level of scalability. NiagaraCQ addresses this problem by grouping continuous queries based on the observation that many web queries share similar structures. Grouped queries can share the common computation, tend to fit in memory and can reduce the I/O cost significantly. Furthermore, grouping on selection predicates can eliminate a large number of unnecessary query invocations. Our grouping technique is distinguished from previous group optimization approaches in the following ways. First, we use an incremental group optimization strategy with dynamic re-grouping. New queries are added to existing query groups, without having to regroup already installed queries. Second, we use a query-split scheme that requires minimal changes to a general-purpose query engine. Third, NiagaraCQ groups both change-based and timer-based queries in a uniform way. To insure that NiagaraCQ is scalable, we have also employed other techniques including incremental evaluation of continuous queries, use of both pull and push models for detecting heterogeneous data source changes, and memory caching. This paper presents the design of NiagaraCQ system and gives some experimental results on the system's performance and scalability.\\n\",\n",

       "  \"AB In this article, we present a new privacy-aware query processing framework, Capser, in which mobile and stationary users can obtain snapshot and/or continuous location-based services without revealing their private location information. In particular, we propose a privacy-aware query processor embedded inside a location-based database server to deal with snapshot and continuous queries based on the knowledge of the user's cloaked location rather than the exact location. Our proposed privacy-aware query processor is completely independent of how we compute the user's cloaked location. In other words, any existing location anonymization algorithms that blur the user's private location into cloaked rectilinear areas can be employed to protect the user's location privacy. We first propose a privacy-aware query processor that not only supports three new privacy-aware query types, but also achieves a trade-off between query processing cost and answer optimality. Then, to improve system scalability of processing continuous privacy-aware queries, we propose a shared execution paradigm that shares query processing among a large number of continuous queries. The proposed scalable paradigm can be tuned through two parameters to trade off between system scalability and answer optimality. Experimental results show that our query processor achieves high quality snapshot and continuous location-based services while supporting queries and/or data with cloaked locations.\\n\",\n",

       "  'AB Virtually all proposals for querying XML include a class of query we term \"containment queries\". It is also clear that in the foreseeable future, a substantial amount of XML data will be stored in relational database systems. This raises the question of how to support these containment queries. The inverted list technology that underlies much of Information Retrieval is well-suited to these queries, but should we implement this technology (a) in a separate loosely-coupled IR engine, or (b) using the native tables and query execution machinery of the RDBMS? With option (b), more than twenty years of work on RDBMS query optimization, query execution, scalability, and concurrency control and recovery immediately extend to the queries and structures that implement these new operations. But all this will be irrelevant if the performance of option (b) lags that of (a) by too much. In this paper, we explore some performance implications of both options using native implementations in two commercial relational database systems and in a special purpose inverted list engine. Our performance study shows that while RDBMSs are generally poorly suited for such queries, under certain conditions they can outperform an inverted list engine. Our analysis further identifies two significant causes that differentiate the performance of the IR and RDBMS implementations: the join algorithms employed and the hardware cache utilization. Our results suggest that contrary to most expectations, with some modifications, a native implementation in an RDBMS can support this class of query much more efficiently\\n',\n",

       " \"AB Hybrid pattern recognition was put forward to discriminate paddy seeds of four different storage periods based on visible/near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (Vis/NIRS). The hybrid pattern recognition included extracting feature and building classifier. A total of 210 samples of paddy seeds, which belonged to four classes, were used for collecting Vis/NIR spectra (3251075 nm) using a field spectroradiometer. The hybrid pattern recognition was integrated with wavelet transform (WT), principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) models. WT was used to eliminate noises and extract characteristic information from spectral data. The characteristic information could be visualized in principal components (PCs) space, in which the structures correlative with the storage periods could be discovered. The first eight PCs, which accounted for 99.94% of the raw spectral data variance, were used as input of the ANN mode, and the model yielded high discrimination accuracy rates of 100%, 100%, 100% and 90% for four classes' samples respectively.\\n\",\n",

The model divided a statement into several parts such as premise, warrant, modality, claim etc., according to the Toulmin argument formalism. \"Modelity\" is designed as a quantitative scale that reflects the expert\\'s attitude to the claim, while premise and warrant are used to provide demonstration for the expert views. We can reach a consensus by computing the value of modality. The model is a comprehensive description of the discussion information, and can effectively manage the discussion information and do consensus building.\\n',\n",

Simulations are performed to validate the scheme for initial alignment, obtained the same precision to other alignment method. And the most splendid was that the using of the LQ optimal control reduces the alignment time consumedly, much more quickly than other traditional method. What is discovered in the simulation is while the initial error angles were smaller than 10 degrees; error angle will converge to quite good precision in several seconds.\\n',\n",

       " 'AB The embedded linear transformation is a popular technique which integrates both transformation and diagonal-covariance Gaussian mixture into a unified framework to improve the performance of speaker recognition. However, the mixture number of GMM must be given in model training. The cluster expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is a well-known technique in which the mixture number is regarded as an estimated parameter. This paper presents a new model that integrates an improved cluster algorithm into the estimating process of GMM with the embedded transformation. In the approach, the transformation matrix, the mixture number and other traditional model parameters are simultaneously estimated according to a maximum likelihood criterion. The proposed method is demonstrated on a database of three data sessions for text independent speaker identification. The experiments show that this method outperforms the traditional GMM with cluster EM algorithm.\\n',\n",

In the schemes, the PKG is prevented forging a legal user's signature for its traceability. Under random oracle model, our schemes are both proved secure against existential forgery on adaptively chosen message and ID attack, assuming the Computational Diffie-Hellman Problem (CDHP) in Diffie-Hellman group is intractable. By comparison, our schemes have higher efficiency than the existing schemes.\\n\",\n",

       " 'AB The exploding growth of the biomedical literature presents many challenges for biological researchers. One such challenge is from the use of a great deal of abbreviations. Extracting abbreviations and their definitions accurately is very helpful to biologists and also facilitates biomedical text analysis. Among existing approaches, text alignment algorithms are simple, effective and require no training data. However state of the art alignment algorithms could not identify the definitions of irregular abbreviations (e.g., < CNS1, cyclophilin seven suppressor>). We propose an algorithm analogous to pairwise sequence alignment, in which it is given a penalty score if there are two unmatched characters separately from the abbreviation and definition, and in this way some irregular abbreviations are found.\\n',\n",

With a little more memory overhead, proposed pruning strategies can prune invalidated search space and decrease the total cost of frequency counting effectively. For effectiveness testing reason, we optimize SPAM [2] and present the improved algorithm, SPAM(SEPIEP), which uses SEP and IEP to prune the search space by sharing the frequent 2-sequences lists. A set of comprehensive performance experiments study shows that SPAM(SEPIEP) outperforms SPAM by a factor of 10 on small datasets and better than 30% to 50% on reasonably large dataset.\\n',\n",

A PDRM (P2P-based Digital Rights Management) system is proposed with the support of Next Generation Internet Project. The system is based on a trust model that focuses on content security, fights management and access control. Encryption, digital watermarking, and packaging technologies are adopted to protect the confidentiality and integrity of contents, and support copyrights verifying and piracy tracing. The structure of fights management integrates the distributed and centralized modes, which not only reduces the burdens of networks and rights server, but also provides controllability. The contents downloaded on the P2P networks can be played only with rights control. To realize access control, the password and identity authentication are used. The PDRM system is implemented to prove that it can provide a more robust Intellectual Property protection solution for P2P content delivery.\\n',\n",

The purpose of the paper is to find an optimum affection factor that may not only reflect nature characteristic of clustering data sample, but also reduce influence caused by sample deviation to minimum. In this paper, an affection interval concept is defined at first. Then an optimum objective function for reducing influence of sample deviation is constructed and an approximate solution is given of optimum affection factor. In the end, a standard data set offered in the MATLAB is used to test the availability of the optimum affection factor, the result is satisfactory.\\n',\n",

       " 'AB While null space based linear discriminant analysis (NLDA) obtains a good discriminant performance, the ability easily suffers from an implicit assumption of Gaussian model with same covariance each class. Meanwhile, mixture model discriminant analysis, which is a good way for processing issues on multiple subclasses in each class, depends on human experience on the number of subclasses and has a highly complex iterative process. Considering the cons and pros of the two mentioned approaches, we therefore propose a new algorithm, called Spectral clustering based Null space Linear Discriminant Analysis (SNLDA). The main contributions of the algorithm include the following three aspects: 1) Employing a new spectral clustering method which can automatically detect the number of clusters in each class. 2) Finding a unified null space for processing multi-subclasses issues with eigen-solution technique. 3) Refining the calculation of the covariance matrix in a single sample subclass. The experimental results show the promising of the proposed SNLDA algorithm.\\n',\n",

Based on the research of related works, the optimization principle of restart tree is analyzed and a novel approach is proposed for optimizing restart tree. In this approach, mean failure frequencies of components are obtained by injecting exceptions during load testing, which could be used to compute and analyze the failure correlation degrees between components. The components with high failure correlation degrees are constructed as a restart group to realize the optimization of restart tree. The results of the case study show that this approach reduces the mean time to recovery of componentized distributed application and implements the optimization of restart tree.\\n',\n",
