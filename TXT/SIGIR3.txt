AB In this paper we describe a small content-based visual recommendation project built as part of the Allegro online marketplace platform. We extracted relevant data only from images, as they are inherently better at capturing visual attributes than textual offer descriptions. We used several image descriptors to extract color and texture information in order to find visually similar items. We tested our results against available textual offer tags and also asked human users to subjectively assess the precision. Finally, we deployed the solution to our platform.

DE Privacy-Preserving Information Retrieval
AB Due to lack of mature techniques in privacy-preserving information retrieval (IR), concerns about information privacy and security have become serious obstacles that prevent valuable user data to be used in IR research such as studies on query logs, social media, and medical record retrieval. In SIGIR 2014 and SIGIR 2015, we have run the privacy-preserving IR workshops exploring and understanding the privacy and security risks in information retrieval. This year, we continue the efforts of connecting the two disciplines of IR and privacy/ security by organizing this workshop. We target on three themes, differential privacy and IR dataset release, privacy in search and browsing, and privacy in social media. The workshop include panels with researchers from both fields on these three themes, as well as invite industry speakers for real-world challenges. The goals of this workshop include (1) bringing together the two research fields, and (2) yielding fruitful collaborations.

AB Web search queries provide a surprisingly large amount of information, which can be potentially organized and converted into a knowledgebase. In this paper, we focus on the problem of automatically identifying brand and product entities from a large collection of web queries in online shopping domain. We propose an unsupervised approach based on adaptor grammars that does not require any human annotation efforts nor rely on any external resources. To reduce the noise and normalize the query patterns, we introduce a query standardization step, which groups multiple search patterns and word orderings together into their most frequent ones. We present three different sets of grammar rules used to infer query structures and extract brand and product entities. To give an objective assessment of the performance of our approach, we conduct experiments on a large collection of online shopping queries and intrinsically evaluate the knowledgebase generated by our method qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, we also evaluate our framework on extrinsic tasks on query tagging and chunking. Our empirical studies show that the knowledgebase discovered by our approach is highly accurate, has good coverage and significantly improves the performance on the external tasks.

AB This paper tackles the challenge of accurately and efficiently estimating the number of relevant documents in a collection for a particular topic. One real-world application is estimating the volume of social media posts (e.g., tweets) pertaining to a topic, which is fundamental to tracking the popularity of politicians and brands, the potential sales of a product, etc. Our insight is to leverage active learning techniques to find all the "easy" documents, and then to use sampling techniques to infer the number of relevant documents in the residual collection. We propose a simple yet effective technique for determining this "switchover" point, which intuitively can be understood as the "knee" in an effort vs. recall gain curve, as well as alternative sampling strategies beyond the knee. We show on several TREC datasets and a collection of tweets that our best technique yields more accurate estimates (with the same effort) than several alternatives.

AB With a large amount of complex network data available, most existing recommendation models consider exploiting rich user social relations for better interest targeting. In these approaches, the underlying assumption is that similar users in social networks would prefer similar items. However, in practical scenarios, social link may not be formed by common interest. For example, one general collected social network might be used for various specific recommendation scenarios. The problem of noisy social relations without interest relevance will arise to hurt the performance. Moreover, the sparsity problem of social network makes it much more challenging, due to the two-fold problem needed to be solved simultaneously, for effectively incorporating social information to benefit recommendation. To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive embedding approach to solve the both jointly for better recommendation in real world setting. Experiments conducted on real world datasets show that our approach outperforms current methods.

DE temporal intents; disambiguation
AB Understanding temporal intents behind users' queries is essential to meet users' time-related information needs. In order to classify queries according to their temporal intent (e.g. Past or Future), we explore the usage of time-series data derived from Wikipedia page views as a feature source. While existing works leverage either proprietary search engine query logs or highly processed and aggregated data (such as Google Trends) for this purpose, we investigate the utility of a freely available data source for this purpose. Our experiments on the NTCIR-12 Temporalia-2 dataset show, that Wikipedia pageview-based time-series data can significantly improve the disambiguation of temporal intents for specific types of queries, in particular those without temporal expressions present in the query string.

AB In this paper, we study the emerging Information Retrieval (IR) task of local event retrieval using sensor metadata streams. Sensor metadata streams include information such as the crowd density from video processing, audio classifications, and social media activity. We propose to use these metadata streams to identify the topics of local events within a city, where each event topic corresponds to a set of terms representing a type of events such as a concert or a protest. We develop a supervised approach that is capable of mapping sensor metadata observations to an event topic. In addition to using a variety of sensor metadata observations about the current status of the environment as learning features, our approach incorporates additional background features to model cyclic event patterns. Through experimentation with data collected from two locations in a major Spanish city, we show that our approach markedly outperforms an alternative baseline. We also show that modelling background information improves event topic identification.

AB Modern Web data is highly structured in terms of entities and relations from large knowledge resources, geo-temporal references and social network structure, resulting in a massive multidimensional graph. This graph essentially unifies both the searcher and the information resources that played a fundamentally different role in traditional IR, and "Graph Search" offers major new ways to access relevant information. Graph search affects both query formulation (complex queries about entities and relations building on the searcher's context) as well as result exploration and discovery (slicing and dicing the information using the graph structure) in a completely personalized way. This new graph based approach introduces great opportunities, but also great challenges, in terms of data quality and data integration, user interface design, and privacy.
   We view the notion of "graph search" as searching information from your personal point of view (you are the query) over a highly structured and curated information space. This goes beyond the traditional two-term queries and ten blue links results that users are familiar with, requiring a highly interactive session covering both query formulation and result exploration. The workshop attracted a range of researchers working on this and related topics, and made concrete progress working together on one of the greatest challenges in the years to come.

AB Social signals (users' actions) associated with web resources (documents) can be considered as an additional information that can play a role to estimate a priori importance of the resource. In this paper, we are particularly interested in: first, showing the impact of signals diversity associated to a resource on information retrieval performance; second, studying the influence of their social networks origin on their quality. We propose to model these social features as prior that we integrate into language model. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach on IMDb dataset containing 167438 resources and their social signals collected from several social networks. Our experimental results are statistically significant and show the interest of integrating signals diversity in the retrieval process.

DE Question Answering; Question Routing; Social Media
AB The last two decades have made the Internet a major source for knowledge seekers to fulfill their needs. Several tools and platforms were developed to find answers to one's questions such as search engines and online encyclopedias. The wide adoption of social media pushed the possibilities even further by giving people the opportunity to stimulate the generation of answers that are not already present on the Internet. Some of these are primarily community question answering (CQA) services, while the others have a more general audience but can also be used to ask and answer questions.
   Assessing which platform is best suitable for certain information need of a particular user, and subject to some specific constraints, is a problem that has seen little attention (e.g. [3]). Hence, we consider cross-platform question routing to automatically suggest where an input question should be asked or redirected to. Several stages are required to address this problem. First, we need to analyze the differences between the questions asked on different platforms. In fact, on a search engine, a user would provide the least context to the query. On a CQA website, she would summarize the question in a title and provide more context in a description. On the other hand, the (online) identity of the asker in a microblogging service is revealed to her friends, leading to a higher exposure of context. For this stage, we gather questions from different platforms to train a classifier on the distribution of question types [4] over these platforms. Services that are not restricted to questions and answers (e.g., Twitter) need special mining to find content that contains questions. We will extend the work of [2] to find out which posts are answer seeking questions.
   Second, we need to characterize the users, as not all demographics have the same needs. For instance, the types of information seeked by a journalist are arguably different from those of a teenager. Thus, we build some classifiers that differentiate users based on the questions they might ask. We apply some algorithms that we developed to retrieve the Twitter accounts of Arab journalists, and adapt the taxonomy of the more general question types to this group of professionals.
   Routing questions needs new evaluation measures that take in consideration various aspects beyond the traditional dimension of relevance. For instance, for a user who is seeking opinions of "ordinary" people about non-factoid questions, informality of the answers is a constraint that might be added to the evaluation [1]. The cost of wrong answers is an additional dimension to the evaluation that is often traded-off with response time. For example, a journalist cannot accept an unverified report and might spend a long time verifying it. On another hand, someone who is trying to get recommendations for a nearby restaurant might trade the correctness for a timely answer. Thus, we need to model the likelihood of whether and when a question will get a response, if a response contains an answer to that question and to which extent that answer is correct and satisfies the expectations of the asker.

DE diversity; preference judgment; user study
AB Different users may be attempting to satisfy different information needs while providing the same query to a search engine. Addressing that issue is addressing Novelty and Diversity in information retrieval. Novelty and Diversity search models the retrieval task wherein users are interested in seeing documents that are not only relevant, but also cover more aspects (or subtopics) related to the topic of interest. This is in contrast with the traditional IR task in which topical relevance is the only factor in evaluating search results. In this paper, we conduct a user study where users are asked to give a preference between one of two documents B and C given a query and also given that they have already seen a document A. We then test a total of ten hypotheses pertaining to the relationship between the "comprehensiveness" of documents (i.e. the number of subtopics a document is relevant to) and real users' preference judgments. Our results show that users are inclined to prefer documents with higher comprehensiveness, even when the prior document A already covers more aspects than the two documents being compared, and even when the less preferred document has a higher relevance grade. In fact, users are inclined to prefer documents with higher overall aspect -coverage even in cases where B and C are relevant to the same number of novel subtopics.

AB Users' music preferences can be greatly influenced by their location and environment nearby. In this demonstration, we present an intelligent music recommender system, called VenueMusic, to automatically identify suitable music for various popular venues in our daily lives. VenueMusic enjoys a set of nice features: i) music concept sequence generation scheme and Location-aware Topic Model (LTM) are proposed to map the characteristics of venues and music into a latent semantic space, where suitability of music for a venue can be directly measured, ii) a smart interface enabling user to smoothly interact with VenueMusic, and iii) high quality music playlist. The demonstration will show several interesting use-cases of VenueMusic, and illustrate its superiority on recommending music based on where user presents.

DE distributed retrieval; selective search; variance
AB Selective distributed search is a retrieval architecture that reduces search costs by partitioning a corpus into topical shards such that only a few shards need to be searched for each query. Prior research created topical shards by using random seed documents to cluster a random sample of the full corpus. The resource selection algorithm might use a different random sample of the corpus. These random components make selective search non-deterministic.
   This paper studies how these random components affect experimental results. Experiments on two ClueWeb09 corpora and four query sets show that in spite of random components, selective search is stable for most queries.

AB This short paper presents initial results from a project, in which we investigated differences in how users view relevant and irrelevant Web pages on their visits and revisits. The users' viewing of Web pages was characterized by eye-tracking measures, with a particular attention paid to changes in pupil size. The data was collected in a lab-based experiment, in which users (N=32) conducted assigned information search tasks on Wikipedia. We performed non-parametric tests of significance as well as classification. Our findings demonstrate differences in eye-tracking measures on visits and revisits to relevant and irrelevant pages and thus indicate a feasibility of predicting perceived Web document relevance from eye-tracking data. In particular, relative changes in pupil size differed significantly in almost all conditions. Our work extends results from previous studies to more realistic search scenarios and to Web page visits and revisits.

DE Collaborative filtering; Shilling attack; Hubness
AB It is known that memory-based collaborative filtering systems are vulnerable to shilling attacks. In this paper, we demonstrate that hubness, which occurs in high dimensional data, is exploited by the attacks. Hence we explore methods for reducing hubness in user-response data to make these systems robust against attacks. Using the MovieLens dataset, we empirically show that the two methods for reducing hubness by transforming a similarity matrix (i) centering and (ii) conversion to a commute time kernel can thwart attacks without degrading the recommendation performance.

DE Temporal IR; Ensemble learning; Multi-objective optimization
AB Understanding the temporal orientation of web search queries is an important issue for the success of information access systems. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective ensemble learning solution that (1) allows to accurately classify queries along their temporal intent and (2) identifies a set of performing solutions thus offering a wide range of possible applications. Experiments show that correct representation of the problem can lead to great classification improvements when compared to recent state-of-the-art solutions and baseline ensemble techniques.

DE Simulation; Search behavior; Faceted search; Evaluation
AB Traditional batch evaluation metrics assume that user interaction with search results is limited to scanning down a ranked list. However, modern search interfaces come with additional elements supporting result list refinement (RLR) through facets and filters, making user search behavior increasingly dynamic. We develop an evaluation framework that takes a step beyond the interaction assumption of traditional evaluation metrics and allows for batch evaluation of systems with and without RLR elements. In our framework we model user interaction as switching between different sub-lists. This provides a measure of user effort based on the joint effect of user interaction with RLR elements and result quality.
   We validate our framework by conducting a user study and comparing model predictions with real user performance. Our model predictions show significant positive correlation with real user effort. Further, in contrast to traditional evaluation metrics, the predictions using our framework, of when users stand to benefit from RLR elements, reflect findings from our user study.
   Finally, we use the framework to investigate under what conditions systems with and without RLR elements are likely to be effective. We simulate varying conditions concerning ranking quality, users, task and interface properties demonstrating a cost-effective way to study whole system performance.

ID QUESTION-NEGOTIATION; RETRIEVAL; LIBRARIES; SEEKING
AB Taylor's concept of levels of information need [ 16] has been cited in over a hundred IR publications since his work was first published. It concerns the phases a searcher goes through, starting with the feeling that information seems missing, to expressing a query to the system that hopefully will provide that information. As every year more IR publications reference Taylor's work, but none of these so much as attempt to formalize the concept they use, it is doubtful that the term is always used with the same connotation. Hence we propose a formal de finition of levels of information need, as especially in IR with its formal underpinnings, there is no excuse to leave frequently used terms undefined.
   We cast Taylor's informally de fined levels of information need - and the transitions between them - as an evolving dynamical system subsuming two subsystems: the searcher and the search engine. This moves the focus from optimizing the search engine to optimizing the search interface. We de fine the quality of an interface by how much users need to compromise in order to fill their information need. We show how a theoretical optimum can be calculated that assumes the least compromise from the user. This optimum can be used to establish a base-line for measuring how much a search interface deviates from the ideal, given actual search behavior, and by the same token offers a measure of comparison among competing interfaces.

DE Collaborative search; non-uniform access; effectiveness measures
AB The majority of research into Collaborative Information Retrieval (CIR) has assumed a uniformity of information access and visibility between collaborators. However in a number of real world scenarios, information access is not uniform between all collaborators in a team e.g. security, health etc. This can be referred to as Multi-Level Collaborative Information Retrieval (MLCIR). To the best of our knowledge, there has not yet been any systematic investigation of the effect of MLCIR on search outcomes. To address this shortcoming, in this paper, we present the results of a simulated evaluation conducted over 4 different non-uniform information access scenarios and 3 different collaborative search strategies. Results indicate that there is some tolerance to removing access to the collection and that there may not always be a negative impact on performance. We also highlight how different access scenarios and search strategies impact on search outcomes.

DE In situ insights; entity recommendation
AB When consuming content in applications such as e-readers, word processors, and Web browsers, users often see mentions to topics (or concepts) that attract their attention. In a scenario of significant practical interest, topics are explored in situ, without leaving the context of the application: The user selects a mention of a topic (in the form of continuous text), and the system subsequently recommends references (e.g., Wikipedia concepts) that are relevant in the context of the application. In order to realize this experience, it is necessary to tackle challenges that include: users may select any continuous text, even potentially noisy text for which there is no corresponding reference in the knowledge base; references must be relevant to both the user selection and the text around it; and the real estate available on the application may be constrained, thus limiting the number of results that can be shown.
   In this paper, we study this novel recommendation task, that we call in situ insights: recommending reference concepts in response to a text selection and its context in-situ of a document consumption application. We first propose a selection-centric context language model and a selection centric context semantic model to capture user interest. Based on these models, we then measure the quality of a reference concept across three aspects: selection clarity, context coherence, and concept relevance. By leveraging all these aspects, we put forward a machine learning approach to simultaneously decide if a selection is noisy, and filter out low-quality candidate references. In order to quantitatively evaluate our proposed techniques, we construct a test collection based on the simulation of the in situ insights scenario using crowd sourcing in the context of a real-word e-reader application. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

DE E-Recruitment; Job Categorization; Classification
AB E-recruitment uses a range of web-based technologies to find, evaluate, and hire new personnel for organizations. A crucial challenge in this arena lies in the categorization of job offers: candidates and operators often explore and analyze large numbers of offers and profiles through a set of job categories. To date, recruitment organizations define job categories top-down, relying on standardized vocabularies that often fail to capture new skills and requirements that emerge from dynamic labor markets. In order to support e-recruitment, this paper presents a dynamic, bottom-up method to automatically enrich and revise job categories. The method detects novel, highly characterizing terms in a corpus of job offers, leading to a more effective categorization, and is evaluated on real-world data by Multiposting (http://www.multiposting.fr/en), a large French e-recruitment firm.

AB Effective postings list compression techniques, and the efficiency of postings list processing schemes such as WAND, have significantly improved the practical performance of ranked document retrieval using inverted indexes. Recently, suffix array-based index structures have been proposed as a complementary tool, to support phrase searching. The relative merits of these alternative approaches to ranked querying using phrase components are, however, unclear. Here we provide: (1) an overview of existing phrase indexing techniques; (2) a description of how to incorporate recent advances in list compression and processing; and (3) an empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art suffix-array and inverted file-based phrase retrieval indexes using a standard IR test collection.

DE recall; assessor error; evaluation; eDiscovery; electronic discovery;
   relevance ranking; supervised learning
AB We are concerned with the effect of using a surrogate assessor to train a passive (i.e., batch) supervised-learning method to rank documents for subsequent review, where the effectiveness of the ranking will be evaluated using a different assessor deemed to be authoritative. Previous studies suggest that surrogate assessments may be a reasonable proxy for authoritative assessments for this task. Nonetheless, concern persists in some application domains such as electronic discovery that errors in surrogate training assessments will be amplified by the learning method, materially degrading performance. We demonstrate, through a re-analysis of data used in previous studies, that, with passive supervised-learning methods, using surrogate assessments for training can substantially impair classifier performance, relative to using the same deemed-authoritative assessor for both training and assessment. In particular, using a single surrogate to replace the authoritative assessor for training often yields a ranking that must be traversed much lower to achieve the same level of recall as the ranking that would have resulted had the authoritative assessor been used for training. We also show that steps can be taken to mitigate, and sometimes overcome, the impact of surrogate assessments for training: relevance assessments may be diversified through the use of multiple surrogates; and, a more liberal view of relevance can be adopted by having the surrogate label borderline documents as relevant. By taking these steps, rankings derived from surrogate assessments can match, and sometimes exceed, the performance of the ranking that would have been achieved, had the authority been used for training. Finally, we show that our results still hold when the role of surrogate and authority are interchanged, indicating that the results may simply reflect differing conceptions of relevance between surrogate and authority, as opposed to the authority having special skill or knowledge lacked by the surrogate.

AB System combination is an effective strategy to boost retrieval performance, especially in complex applications such as cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) where the aspects of translation and retrieval have to be optimized jointly. We focus on machine learning-based approaches to CUR that need large sets of relevance-ranked data to train high-dimensional models. We compare these models under various measures of orthogonality, and present an experimental evaluation on two different domains (patents, Wikipedia) and two different language pairs (Japanese-English, German-English). We show that gains of over 10 points in MAP/NDCG can be achieved over the best single model by a linear combination of the models that contribute the most orthogonal information, rather than by combining the models with the best standalone retrieval performance.

DE Multi-document summarization; matrix factorization; manifold ranking
AB Manifold-ranking has proved to be an effective method for topic focused multi-document summarization. As basic manifold ranking based summarization method constructs the relationships between sentences simply by the bag-of-words cosine similarity, we believe a better similarity metric will further improve the effectiveness of manifold-ranking. In this paper, we propose a joint optimization framework, which integrates the manifold-ranking process with a similarity metric learning process. The joint framework aims at learning better sentence similarity scores and better sentence ranking scores simultaneously. Experiments on DUC datasets show the proposed joint method achieves better performance than the manifold-ranking baselines and several popular methods.

   Domain-specific Browsing Graphs
ID RANDOM FORESTS
AB The "Local Ranking Problem" (LRP) is related to the computation of a centrality-like rank on a local graph, where the scores of the nodes could significantly differ from the ones computed on the global graph. Previous work has studied LRP on the hyperlink graph but never on the BrowseGraph, namely a graph where nodes are webpages and edges are browsing transitions. Recently, this graph has received more and more attention in many different tasks such as ranking, prediction and recommendation. However, a webserver has only the browsing traffic performed on its pages (local BrowseGraph) and, as a consequence, the local computation can lead to estimation errors, which hinders the increasing number of applications in the state of the art. Also, although the divergence between the local and global ranks has been measured, the possibility of estimating such divergence using only local knowledge has been mainly overlooked. These aspects are of great interest for online service providers who want to: (i) gauge their ability to correctly assess the importance of their resources only based on their local knowledge, and (ii) take into account real user browsing fluxes that better capture the actual user interest than the static hyperlink network. We study the LRP problem on a BrowseGraph from a large news provider, considering as subgraphs the aggregations of browsing traces of users coming from di. erent domains. We show that the distance between rankings can be accurately predicted based only on structural information of the local graph, being able to achieve an average rank correlation as high as 0.8.

DE Attribution-based personalization; Interest model; Personalization
AB Search personalization tailors the search experience to individual searchers. To do this, search engines construct interest models comprising signals from observed behavior associated with machines, often via Web browser cookies or other user identifiers. However, shared device usage is common, meaning that the activities of multiple searchers may be interwoven in the interest models generated. Recent research on activity attribution has led to methods to automatically disentangle the histories of multiple searchers and correctly ascribe newly-observed search activity to the correct person. Building on this, we introduce attribution-based personalization (ABP), a procedure that extends traditional personalization to target individual searchers on shared devices. Activity attribution may improve personalization, but its benefits are not yet fully understood. We present an oracle study (with perfect knowledge of which searchers perform each action on each machine) to understand the effectiveness of ABP in predicting searchers' future interests. We utilize a large Web search log dataset containing both person identifiers and machine identifiers to quantify the gain in personalization performance from ABP, identify the circumstances under which ABP is most effective, and develop a classifier to determine when to apply it that yields sizable gains in personalization performance. ABP allows search providers to personalize experiences for individuals rather than targeting all users of a device collectively.

DE Multiple Domains; Recommendation; Conformity
AB Existing recommender systems place emphasis on personalization to achieve promising accuracy. However, in the context of multiple domain, users are likely to seek the same behaviors as domain authorities. This conformity effect provides a wealth of prior knowledge when it comes to multi domain recommendation, but has not been fully exploited. In particular, users whose behaviors are significant similar with the public tastes can be viewed as domain authorities. To detect these users meanwhile embed conformity into recommendation, a domain-specific similarity matrix is intuitively employed. Therefore, a collective similarity is obtained to leverage the conformity with personalization. In this paper, we establish a Collective Structure Sparse Representation(CSSR) method for multi-domain recommendation. Based on adaptive k-Nearest-Neighbor framework, we impose the lasso and group lasso penalties as well as least square loss to jointly optimize the collective similarity. Experimental results on real-world data confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

DE Query-by-sketch; motion queries; query formulation; query expansion;
   video retrieval; content-based information retrieval
AB Searching for scenes in team sport videos is a task that recurs very often in game analysis and other related activities performed by coaches. In most cases, queries are formulated on the basis of specific motion characteristics the user remembers from the video. Providing sketching interfaces for graphically specifying query input is thus a very natural user interaction for a retrieval application. However, the quality of the query (the sketch) heavily depends on the memory of the user and her ability to accurately formulate the intended search query by transforming this 3D memory of the known item(s) into a 2D sketch query. In this paper, we present an auto-suggest search feature that harnesses spatiotemporal data of team sport videos to suggest potential directions containing relevant data during the formulation of a sketch-based motion query. Users can intuitively select the direction of the desired motion query on-the-fly using the displayed visual clues, thus relaxing the need for relying heavily on memory to formulate the query. At the same time, this significantly enhances the accuracy of the results and the speed at which they appear. A first evaluation has shown the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

DE Web search engine; search engine bias
ID BIAS
AB Millions of people search the Web each day. As a consequence, the ranking algorithms employed by Web search engines have a profound influence on which pages users visit. Characterizing this influence, and informing users when different engines favor certain sites or points of view, enables more transparent access to the Web's information.
   We present PAWS, a platform for analyzing differences among Web search engines. PAWS measures content emphasis: the degree to which differences across search engines' rankings correlate with features of the ranked content, including point of view (e.g., positive or negative orientation toward their company's products) and advertisements. We propose an approach for identifying the orientations in search results at scale, through a novel technique that minimizes the expected number of human judgments required. We apply PAWS to news search on Google and Bing, and find no evidence that the engines emphasize results that express positive orientation toward the engine company's products. We do find that the engines emphasize particular news sites, and that they also favor pages containing their company's advertisements, as opposed to competitor advertisements.

DE Sponsored search; positional effect; click model; experiment
AB Click logs provide a unique and highly valuable source of human judgments on ads' relevance. However, clicks are heavily biased by lots of factors. Two main factors that are widely acknowledged to be the most influential ones are neighboring ads and presentation order. The latter is referred to as positional effect. A popular practice to recover the ads quality cleaned from positional bias is to adopt click models based on examination or cascade hypothesis originally developed for organic search. In this paper we show the strong evidence that this practice is far from perfection when considering the top ads block on a search engine result page (SERP). We show that cascade hypothesis is the most questionable one because of important differences between organic and sponsored search results that may encourage users to analyze the whole ads-block before clicking. Additionally, we design a testing setup for an unbiased evaluation of click model prediction accuracy.

DE Crowdsourcing; query logs; query annotation; user studies
AB A query log is a key asset in a commercial search engine. Everyday millions of users rely on search engines to find information on the Web by entering a few keywords on a simple search interface. Those queries represent a subset of user behavioral data which is used to mine and discover search patterns for improving the overall end user experience. While queries are very useful, it is not always possible to capture precisely what the user was looking for when the intent is not that clear. We explore a different alternative based on human computation to gather a bit more information from users and show the type of query log that would be possible to construct.

DE Collaborative search; Interactive IR; Query reformulation
AB Users often reformulate or modify their queries when they engage in searching information particularly when the search task is complex and exploratory. This paper investigates query reformulation behavior in collaborative tourism information searching on the Web. A user study was conducted with 17 pairs of participants and each pair worked as a team collaboratively on an exploratory travel search task in two scenarios. We analyzed users' collaborative query (CQ) reformulation behavior in two dimensions: firstly, CQ reformulation strategies; and secondly, the effect of individual queries and chat logs on CQ reformulation. The findings show that individual queries and chat logs were two major sources of query terms in CQ reformulation. The statistical results demonstrate the significant effect of individual queries on CQ reformulation. We also found that five operations were performed to reformulate the CQs, namely: addition, modification, reordering, addition and modification, and addition and reordering. These findings have implications for the design of query suggestions that could be offered to users during searches using collaborative search tools.

DE Retrievability; Effectiveness; Evaluation
AB Retrievability is an important and interesting indicator that can be used in a number of ways to analyse Information Retrieval systems arid document collections. Rather than focusing totally on relevance, retrievability examines what is retrieved, how often it is retrieved, and whether a user is likely to retrieve a document or not. This is important because a document needs to be retrieved, before it can be judged for relevance. In this tutorial, we shall explain the concept of retrievability along with a number of retrievability measures, how it can be estimated and how it can be used for analysis. Since retrieval precedes relevance, we shall also provide an overview of how retrievability relates to effectiveness - describing some of the insights that researchers have discovered so far. We shall also show how retrievability relates to efficiency, and how the theory of retrievability can be used to improve both effectiveness and efficiency. Then we shall provide an overview of the different applications of retrievability such as Search Engine Bias, Corpus Profiling, etc., before wrapping up with challenges and opportunities. The final session of the day will look at example problems and ways to analyse and apply retrievability to other problems and domains.

AB Large-scale web search engines rely on massive compute infrastructures to be able to cope with the continuous growth of the Web and their user bases. In such search engines, achieving scalability and efficiency requires making careful architectural design choices while devising algorithmic performance optimizations. Unfortunately, most details about the internal functioning of commercial web search engines remain undisclosed due to their financial value and the high level of competition in the search market. The main objective of this tutorial is to provide an overview of the fundamental scalability and efficiency challenges in commercial web search engines, bridging the existing gap between the industry and academia.

DE Duplicate Detection; Evaluation; Pooling
AB We examine the effects of expanding a judged set of sentences with their duplicates from a corpus. Including new sentences that are exact duplicates of the previously judged sentences may allow for better estimation of performance metrics and enhance the reusability of a test collection. We perform experiments in context of the Temporal Summarization Track at TREC 2013. We find that adding duplicate sentences to the judged set does not significantly affect relative system performance. However, we do find statistically significant changes in the performance of nearly half the systems that participated in the Track. We recommend adding exact duplicate sentences to the set of relevance judgements in order to obtain a more accurate estimate of system performance.

AB Enterprise computer networks are filled with users performing a variety of tasks, ranging from business-critical tasks to personal interest browsing. Due to this multi-modal distribution of behaviors, it is non-trivial to automatically discern which behaviors are business-relevant and which are not. Additionally, it is difficult to infer communities of interest within the enterprise, even given an organizational mapping. In this work, we present a two-step framework for classifying user behavior within an enterprise in a data-driven way. As a first step, we use a latent topic model on active search queries to identify types of behaviors and topics of interest associated with a given user. We then leverage the information about user's assigned role within the organization to extract relevant topics which are most reflective of self-organizing communities of interest. We demonstrate that our framework is able to identify rich communities of interest that are better representations of how users interact and assemble in an enterprise setting.

DE Twitter; expert finding; local expert; social tagging; crowdsourcing
AB This paper addresses the problem of identifying local experts in social media systems like Twitter. Local experts - in contrast to general topic experts - have specialized knowledge focused around a particular location, and are important for many applications including answering local information needs and interacting with community experts. And yet identifying these experts is difficult. Hence in this paper, we propose a geo-spatial-driven approach for identifying local experts that leverages the fine-grained GPS coordinates of millions of Twitter users. We propose a local expertise framework that integrates both users' topical expertise and their local authority. Concretely, we estimate a user's local authority via a novel spatial proximity expertise approach that leverages over 15 million geo-tagged Twitter lists. We estimate a user's topical expertise based on expertise propagation over 600 million geo-tagged social connections on Twitter. We evaluate the proposed approach across 56 queries coupled with over 11,000 individual judgments from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We find significant improvement over both general (non-local) expert approaches and comparable local expert finding approaches.

DE Document filtering; Entity retrieval; Boolean models
AB Entity-centric document filtering is the task of analyzing a time-ordered stream of documents and emitting those that are relevant to a specified set of entities (e.g., people, places, organizations). This task is exemplified by the TREC Knowledge Base Acceleration (KBA) track and has broad applicability in other modern IR settings. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach based on learning high-quality Boolean queries that can be applied deterministically during filtering. We call these Boolean statements sufficient queries. We argue that using deterministic queries for entity-centric filtering can reduce confounding factors seen in more familiar "score-then-threshold" filtering methods. Experiments on two standard datasets show significant improvements over state-of-the-art baseline models.

DE Query by Example; Similar Chess Positions
ID QUERY
AB We address the problem of retrieving chess game positions similar to a given query position from a collection of archived chess games. We investigate this problem from an information retrieval (IR) perspective. The advantage of our proposed IR-based approach is that it allows using the standard inverted organization of stored chess positions, leading to an efficient retrieval. Moreover, in contrast to retrieving exactly identical board positions, the IR-based approach is able to provide approximate search functionality. In order to define the similarity between two chess board positions, we encode each game state with a textual representation. This textual encoding is designed to represent the position, reachability and the connectivity between chess pieces. Due to the absence of a standard IR dataset that can be used for this search task, a new evaluation benchmark dataset was constructed comprising of documents (chess positions) from a freely available chess game archive. Experiments conducted on this dataset demonstrate that our proposed method of similarity computation, which takes into account a combination of the mobility and the connectivities between the chess pieces, performs well on the search task, achieving MAP and nDCG values of 0.4233 and 0.6922 respectively.

DE Relevance; images; effort; judgment; assessment
AB How assessors and end users judge the relevance of images has been studied in information science and information retrieval for a considerable time. The criteria by which assessors' judge relevance has been intensively studied, and there has been a large amount of work which has investigated how relevance judgments for test collections can be more cheaply generated, such as through crowd sourcing. Relatively little work has investigated the process individual assessors go through to judge the relevance of an image. In this paper, we focus on the process by which relevance is judged for images, and in particular, the degree of effort a user must expend to judge relevance for different topics. Results suggest that topic difficulty and how semantic/visual a topic is impact user performance and perceived effort.

DE search engine competition; dueling algorithms
AB How can a search engine with a relatively weak relevance ranking function compete with a search engine that has a much stronger ranking function? This dual challenge, which to the best of our knowledge has not been addressed in previous work, entails an interesting bi-modal utility function for the weak search engine. That is, the goal is to produce in response to a query a document result list whose effectiveness does not fall much behind that of the strong search engine; and, which is quite different than that of the strong engine. We present a per-query algorithmic approach that leverages fundamental retrieval principles such as pseudo-feedback-based relevance modeling. We demonstrate the merits of our approach using TREC data.

DE Web search engine; admission policy; caching; prefetching
AB Caching query results is an efficient technique for Web search engines. Admission policy can prevent infrequent queries from taking space of more frequent queries in the cache. In this paper we present two novel admission policies tailored for query results cache. These policies are based on query results prefetching information. We also propose a demote operation for the query results cache to improve the cache hit ratio. We then use a trace of over 5 million queries to evaluate our admission policies, as well as traditional policies. Experimental results show that our prefetch-aware admission policies can achieve hit ratios better than state-of the-art admission policies.

DE Twitter; Wikipedia; Tag recommendation
AB With the rise in popularity of smart phones, there has been a recent increase in the number of images taken at large social (e.g. festivals) and world (e.g. natural disasters) events which are uploaded to image sharing websites such as Flickr. As with all online images, they are often poorly annotated, resulting in a difficult retrieval scenario. To overcome this problem, many photo tag recommendation methods have been introduced, however, these methods all rely on historical Flickr data which is often problematic for a number of reasons, including the time lag problem (i.e. in our collection, users upload images on average 50 days after taking them, meaning "training data" is often out of date). In this paper, we develop an image annotation model which exploits textual content from related Twitter and Wikipedia data which aims to overcome the discussed problems. The results of our experiments show and highlight the merits of exploiting social media data for annotating event images, where we are able to achieve recommendation accuracy comparable with a state-of-the-art model.

DE Web Services; Search Engine; Earth Mover's Distance
AB Finding relevant Web services and composing them into value-added applications is becoming increasingly important in cloud and service based marketplaces. The key problem with current approaches to finding relevant. Web services is that most of them only provide searches over a discrete set of features using exact keyword matching. We demonstrate in this paper that by utilizing well known indexing scheme such as inverted file and R-tree indexes over Web services attributes, the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) algorithm can be used efficiently to find partial matches between a query and a database of Web services.

DE novelty detection; novelty location; academic articles
AB It is becoming increasingly difficult to stay aware of the state-of-the-art in any research field due to the exponential increase in the number of academic publications. This problem effects authors and reviewers of submissions to academic journals and conferences, who must be able to identify which portions of an article are novel and which are not. Therefore, having a process to automatically judge the flow of novelty though a document would assist academics in their quest for truth. In this article, we propose the concept of Within Document Novelty Location, a method of identifying locations of novelty and non-novelty within a given document. In this preliminary investigation, we examine if a second order statistical model has any benefit, in terms of accuracy and confidence, over a simpler first order model. Experiments on 928 text sequences taken from three academic articles showed that the second order model provided a significant increase in novelty location accuracy for two of the three documents. There was no significant difference in accuracy for the remaining document, which is likely to be due to the absence of context analysis.

DE entity retrieval; query performance prediction
AB We address the query-performance-prediction task for entity retrieval; that is, retrieval effectiveness is estimated with no relevance judgements. First we show how to adapt state-of-the-art query-performance predictors proposed for document retrieval to the entity retrieval domain. We then present a novel predictor that is based on the cluster hypothesis. Evaluation performed with the INEX entity ranking track collections shows that our predictor can often out-perform the most effective predictors we experimented with.

DE Cluster labeling; Fusion
AB We present a novel approach to the cluster labeling task using fusion methods. The core idea of our approach is to weigh labels, suggested by any labeler, according to the estimated labeler's decisiveness with respect to each of its suggested labels. We hypothesize that, a cluster labeler's labeling choice for a given cluster should remain stable even in the presence of a slightly incomplete cluster data. Using state-of-the-art cluster labeling and data fusion methods, evaluated over a large data collection of clusters, we demonstrate that, overall, the cluster labeling fusion methods that further consider the labeler's decisiveness provide the best labeling performance.

DE Query segmentation; POS tagging; IR evaluation
AB We present a generic method for augmenting unsupervised query segmentation by incorporating Parts-of-Speech (POS) sequence information to detect meaningful but rare n-grams. Our initial experiments with an existing English POS tagger employing two different POS tagsets and an unsupervised POS induction technique specifically adapted for queries show that POS information can significantly improve query segmentation performance in all these cases.

ID SEEKING
AB Extensive previous research has shown that searchers often require assistance with query formulation and refinement. Yet, it is not clear what kind of assistance is most useful, and how effective it is both objectively (e.g., in terms of task success) and subjectively (e.g., in terms of searcher perception of the search difficulty). This work describes the results of a controlled user study comparing the effects of providing specific vs. generic search hints on search success and satisfaction. Our results indicate that specific search hints tend to effectively improve searcher success rates and reduce perceived effort, while generic ones can be detrimental in both search effectiveness and user satisfaction. The results of this study are an important step towards the design of future search systems that could effectively assist and guide the user in accomplishing complex search tasks.

AB The Web is an important resource for understanding and diagnosing medical conditions. Based on exposure to online content, people may develop undue health concerns, believing that common and benign symptoms are explained by serious illnesses. In this paper, we investigate potential strategies to mine queries and searcher histories for clues that could help search engines choose the most appropriate information to present in response to exploratory medical queries. To do this, we performed a longitudinal study of health search behavior using the logs of a popular Web search engine. We found that query variations which might appear innocuous (e.g. "bad headache" vs "severe headache") may hold valuable information about the searcher which could be used by search engines to improve performance. Furthermore, we investigated how medically-concerned users respond differently to search engine result pages (SERPs) and find that their disposition for clicking on concerning pages is pronounced, potentially leading to a self-reinforcement of concern. Finally, we studied to which degree variations in the SERP impact future search and real-world health-seeking behavior and obtained some surprising results (e.g., viewing concerning pages may lead to a short-term reduction of in-world healthcare utilization).

DE Aitchison's distance; compositions; distance; similarity; ratio
AB Many techniques in information retrieval produce counts from a sample, and it is common to analyse these counts as proportions of the whole-term frequencies are a familiar example. Proportions carry only relative information and are not free to vary independently of one another: for the proportion of one term to increase, one or more others must decrease. These constraints are hallmarks of compositional data. While there has long been discussion in other fields of how such data should be analysed, to our knowledge, Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) has not been considered in IR.
   In this work we explore compositional data in IR through the lens of distance measures, and demonstrate that common measures, naive to compositions, have some undesirable properties which can be avoided with composition-aware measures. As a practical example, these measures are shown to improve clustering.

DE Evaluation; sampling; measurement error
AB In some jurisdictions, parties to a lawsuit can request documents from each other, but documents subject to a claim of privilege may be withheld. The TREC 2010 Legal Track developed what is presently the only public test collection for evaluating privilege classification. This paper examines the reliability and reusability of that collection. For reliability, the key question is the extent to which privilege judgments correctly reflect the opinion of the senior litigator whose judgment is authoritative. For reusability, the key question is the degree to which systems whose results contributed to creation of the test collection can be fairly compared with other systems that use those privilege judgments in the future. These correspond to measurement error and sampling error, respectively. The results indicate that measurement error is the larger problem.

AB As the scale of available on-line data grows ever larger, individuals and businesses must cope with increasing complexity in decision-making processes which utilize large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured and/or structured data to satisfy multiple, interrelated information needs which contribute to an overall decision. Traditional decision support systems (DSSs) have been developed to address this need, but such systems are typically expensive to build, and are purpose-built for a particular decision-making scenario, making them difficult to extend or adapt to new decision scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel decision representation which allows decision makers to formulate and organize natural language questions or assertions into an analytic hierarchy, which can be evaluated as part of an ad hoc decision process or as a documented, repeatable analytic process. We then introduce a new decision support framework, QUADS, which takes advantage of automatic question answering (QA) technologies to automatically understand and process a decision representation, producing a final decision by gathering and weighting answers to individual questions using a Bayesian learning and inference process. An open source framework implementation is presented and applied to two real world applications: target validation, a fundamental decision-making task for the pharmaceutical industry, and product recommendation from review texts, an everyday decision-making situation faced by online consumers. In both applications, we implemented and compared a number of decision synthesis algorithms, and present experimental results which demonstrate the performance of the QUADS approach versus other baseline approaches.

In this demonstration we show a novel application which automatically classifies images in a live photo stream according to their attractiveness for the community, based on a number of visual and textual features. The system effectively introduces an additional facet to browse and explore photo collections by highlighting the most attractive photographs and demoting the least attractive.

AB We investigate the effectiveness of both the standard evaluation measures and the opinion component for topical opinion retrieval. We analyze how relevance is affected by opinions by perturbing relevance ranking by the outcomes of opinion-only classifiers built by Monte Carlo sampling. Topical opinion rankings are obtained by either re-ranking or filtering the documents of a first-pass retrieval of topic relevance. The proposed approach establishes the correlation between the accuracy and the precision of the classifier and the performance of the topical opinion retrieval. Among other results, it is possible to assess the effectiveness of the opinion component by comparing the effectiveness of the relevance baseline with the topical opinion ranking.

AB In contextual advertising advertisers show ads to users so that they will click on them and eventually purchase a product. Optimizing this action sequence, called the conversion funnel, is the ultimate goal of advertising. Advertisers, however, often have very different sub-goals for their ads such as purchase, request for a quote, or simply a site visit. Often an improvement for one advertiser's goal comes at the expense of others. A single ranking function must balance these different goals in order to make an efficient system for all advertisers. We propose a ranking method that globally balances the goals of all advertisers, while simultaneously improving overall performance. Our method has been shown to improve significantly over the baseline in online traffic at a major ad network.

DE Text similarity; plagiarism detection; cross-language plagiarism
   detection
AB Plagiarism, the unacknowledged reuse of text, has increased in recent years due to the large amount of texts readily available. For instance, recent studies claim that nowadays a high rate of student reports include plagiarism, making manual plagiarism detection practically infeasible.
   Automatic plagiarism detection tools assist experts to analyse documents for plagiarism. Nevertheless, the lack of standard collections with cases of plagiarism has prevented accurate comparing models, making differences hard to appreciate. Seminal efforts on the detection of text reuse [2] have fostered the composition of standard resources for the accurate evaluation and comparison of methods.
   The aim of this PhD thesis is to address three of the main problems in the development of better models for automatic plagiarism detection: (i) the adequate identification of good potential sources for a given suspicious text; (ii) the detection of plagiarism despite modifications, such as words substitution and paraphrasing (special stress is given to cross-language plagiarism); and (iii) the generation of standard collections of cases of plagiarism and text reuse in order to provide a framework for accurate comparison of models.
   Regarding difficulties (i) and (ii), we have carried out preliminary experiments over the METER corpus [2]. Given a suspicious document d(q) and a collection of potential source documents D, the process is divided in two steps. First, a small subset of potential source documents D* subset of D is retrieved. The documents d is an element of D* are the most related to d(q), and, therefore, the most likely to include the source of the plagiarised fragments in it. We performed this stage on the basis of the Kullback-Leibler distance, over a sub-sample of document's vocabularies. Afterwards, a detailed analysis is carried out comparing dq to every d E D* in order to identify potential cases of plagiarism and their source. This comparison was made on the basis of word n-grams, by considering n = {2, 3}. These n-gram levels are flexible enough to properly retrieve plagiarised fragments and their sources despite modifications [1]. The result is offered to the user to take the final decision. Further experiments were done in both stages in order to compare other similarity measures, such as the cosine measure, the Jaccard coefficient and diverse fingerprinting and probabilistic models.
   One of the main weaknesses of currently available models is that they are unable to detect cross-language plagiarism. Approaching the detection of this kind of plagiarism is of high relevance, as the most of the information published is written in English, and authors in other languages may find it attractive to make use of direct translations.
   Our experiments, carried out over parallel and a comparable corpora, show that models of "standard" cross-language information retrieval are not enough. In fact, if the analysed source and target languages are related in some way (common linguistic ancestors or technical vocabulary), a simple comparison based on character n-grams seems to be the option. However; in those cases where the relation between the implied languages is weaker, other models, such as those based on statistical machine translation, are necessary [3].
   We plan to perform further experiments, mainly to approach the detection of cross-language plagiarism. In order to do that, we will use the corpora developed under the framework of the PAN competition on plagiarism detection (cf. PAN@CLEF: http://pan.webis.de). Models that consider cross-language thesauri and comparison of cognates will also be applied.

DE Online advertising; sponsored search; content match
AB Computational advertising is an emerging scientific sub-discipline, at the intersection of large scale search and text analysis, information retrieval, statistical modeling, machine learning, classification, optimization, and microeconomics. The central challenge of computational advertising is to find the "best match" between a given user in a given context and a suitable advertisement. The aim of this tutorial is to present the state of the art in Computational Advertising, in particular in its IR-related aspects, and to expose the participants to the current research challenges in this field. The tutorial does not assume any prior knowledge of Web advertising, and will begin with a comprehensive background survey.
   Going deeper, our focus will be on using a textual representation of the user context to retrieve relevant ads. At first approximation, this process can be reduced to a conventional setup by constructing a query that describes the user context and executing the query against a large inverted index of ads. We show how to augment this approach using query expansion and text classification techniques tuned for the ad-retrieval problem. In particular, we show how to use the Web as a repository of query-specific knowledge and use the Web search results retrieved by the query as a form of a relevance feedback and query expansion. We also present solutions that go beyond the conventional bag of words indexing by constructing additional features using a large external taxonomy and a lexicon of named entities obtained by analyzing the entire Web as a corpus.
   The last part of the tutorial will be devoted to a potpourri of recent research results and open problems inspired by Computational Advertising challenges in text summarization, natural language generation, named entity recognition, computer-human interaction, and other SIGIR-relevant areas.

DE Re-ranking; Semantics; WordNet
AB A number of works have shown that the aggregation of several information Retrieval (IR) systems works better than each system working individually. Nevertheless, early investigation in the context of CLEF Robust-WSD task, in which semantics is involved, showed that aggregation strategies achieve only slight improvements. This paper proposes a re-ranking approach which relies on inter-document similarities. The novelty of our idea is twofold: the output of a semantic based IR, system is exploited to re-weigh documents and a new strategy based on Semantic Vectors is used to compute inter-document similarities.

DE Query potential for personalization; Classification; Regression
AB The goal of predicting query potential for personalization is to determine which queries can benefit from personalization. In this paper, we investigate which kind of strategy is better for this task: classification or regression. We quantify the potential benefits of personalizing search results using two implicit click-based measures: Click entropy and Potential@N. Meanwhile, queries are characterized by query features and history features. Then we build C-SVM classification model and epsilon-SVM regression model respectively according to these two measures. The experimental results show that the classification model is a better choice for predicting query potential for personalization.

DE Web; Video; Content; text; Classification
AB With the explosive growth of online videos, automatic real-time categorization of Web videos plays a key role for organizing, browsing and retrieving the huge amount of videos on the Web. Previous work shows that, in addition to text features, content features of videos are also useful for Web video classification. Unfortunately, extracting content features is computationally prohibitive for real-time video classification. In this paper we propose a novel video classification framework that is able to exploit both content and text features for video classification while avoiding the expensive computation of extracting content features at classification time. The main idea of our approach is to utilize the content features extracted from training data to enrich the text based semantic kernels, yielding content-enriched semantic kernels. The content-enriched semantic kernels enable to utilize both content and text features for classifying new videos without extracting their content features. The experimental results show that our approach significantly out-performs the state-of-the-art video classification methods.

DE Click-through Data; User Behavior; Search Engines; Statistical Model;
   Metrics
AB We explore a set of hypothesis on user behavior that are potentially at the origin of the (Mean) Average Precision (AP) metric. This allows us to propose a more realistic version of AP where users click non-deterministically on relevant documents and where the number of relevant documents in the collection needs not be known in advance. We then depart from the assumption that a document is either relevant or irrelevant and we use instead relevance judgment similar to editorial labels used for Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG). We assume that clicked documents provide users with a certain level of "utility" and that a user ends a search when she gathered enough utility. Based on the query logs of a commercial search engine we show how to evaluate the utility associated with a label from the record of past user interactions with the search engine and we show how the two different user models can be evaluated based on their ability to predict accurately future clicks. Finally, based on these user models, we propose a measure that captures the relative quality of two rankings.

DE Entity retrieval; Entity profiling; Social network analysis
AB Entity information management (EIM) deals with organizing, processing and delivering information about entities. Its emergence is a result of satisfying more sophisticated information needs that go beyond document search. In the recent years, entity retrieval has attracted much attention in the IR community. INEX has started the XML Entity Ranking track since 2007 and TREC has launched the Entity track since 2009 to investigate the problem of related entity finding. Some EIM problems go beyond retrieval and ranking such as: 1) entity profiling, which is about characterizing a specific entity, and 2) entity distillation, which is about discovering the trend about an entity. These problems have received less attention while they have many important applications.
   On the other hand, the entities in the real world or in the Web environment are usually not isolated. They are connected or related with each other in one way or another. For example, the coauthorship makes the authors with similar research interests be connected. The emergence of social media such as Facebook, Twitter and Youtube has further interweaved the related entities in a much larger scale. Millions of users in these sites can become friends, fans or followers of others, or taggers or commenters of different types of entities (e.g., bookmarks, photos and videos). These networks are complex in the sense that they are heterogeneous with multiple types of entities and of interactions, they are large-scale, they are multi-lingual, and they are dynamic. These features of the complex networks go beyond traditional social network analysis and require further research.
   In this proposed research, I investigate entity information management in the environment of complex networks. The main research question is: how can the EIM tasks be facilitated by modeling the content and structure of complex networks? The research is in the intersection of content based information retrieval and complex network analysis, which deals with both unstructured text data and structured networks. The specific targeting EIM tasks are entity retrieval, entity profiling and entity distillation. In addition to the main research question, the following questions are considered: How can we accomplish a EIM task involving diverse entity and interaction types? How to model the evolution of entity profiles as well as the underlying complex networks? How can the existing cross-language IR work be leveraged to build entity profiles with multi-lingual evidence?
   I propose to use probabilistic models and discriminative models in particular to address the above research questions. In my research, I have developed discriminative models for expert search to integrate arbitrary document features [3] and to learn flexible combination strategies to rank experts in heterogeneous information sources [1]. Discriminative graphical models are proposed to jointly discover homepages by inference on the homepage dependence network [2]. The dependence of table elements is exploited to collectively perform the entity retrieval task [4]. These works have shown the power of discriminative models for entity search and the benefits of utilizing the dependencies among related entities. What I would like to do next is to develop a unified probabilistic framework to investigate the research questions raised in this proposal.

DE Probability Ranking Principle; Language Modeling; Estimation; Term
   Dependence; Cross-language Retrieval
AB Most of today's state-of-the-art retrieval models, including BM25 and language modeling, are grounded in probabilistic principles. Having a working understanding of these principles can help researchers understand existing retrieval models better and also provide industrial practitioners with an understanding of how such models can be applied to real world problems.
   This half-day tutorial will cover the fundamentals of two dominant probabilistic frameworks for Information Retrieval: the classical probabilistic model and the language modeling approach. The elements of the classical framework will include the probability ranking principle, the binary independence model, the 2-Poisson model, and the widely used BM25 model. Within language modeling framework, we will discuss various distributional assumptions and smoothing techniques. Special attention will be devoted to the event spaces and independence assumptions underlying each approach. The tutorial will outline several techniques for modeling term dependence and addressing vocabulary mismatch. We will also survey applications of probabilistic models in the domains of cross-language and multimedia retrieval. The tutorial will conclude by suggesting a set of open problems in probabilistic models of IR.
   Attendees should have a basic familiarity with probability and statistics. A brief refresher of basic concepts, including random variables, event spaces, conditional probabilities, and independence will be given at the beginning of the tutorial. In addition to slides, some hands on exercises and examples will be used throughout the tutorial.

DE Online Advertising; Behavioral Targeting; Learning to Rank
AB Behavioral Targeting (BT) is a recent trend of online advertising market. However, some classical BT solutions, which predefine the user segments for BT ads delivery, are sometimes too large to numerous long-tail advertisers, who cannot afford to buy any large user segments due to budget consideration. In this extend abstract, we propose to rank users according to their probability of interest in an advertisement in a learning to rank framework. We propose to extract three types of features between user behaviors such as search queries, ad click history etc and the ad content provided by advertisers. Through this way, a long-tail advertiser can select a certain number of top ranked users as needed from the user segments for ads delivery. In the experiments, we use a 30-days' ad click-through log from a commercial search engine. The results show that using our proposed features under a learning to rank framework, we can well rank users who potentially interest in an advertisement.

AB In this paper, we propose a new application of Bayesian language model based on Pitman-Yor process for information retrieval. This model is a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution. The Pitman-Yor process creates a power-law distribution which is one of the statistical properties of word frequency in natural language. Our experiments on Robust04 indicate that this model improves the document retrieval performance compared to the commonly used Dirichlet prior and absolute discounting smoothing techniques.

AB While there are many ways to develop search expertise, I maintain that most members of the general public do so in an inefficient manner. One reason is that, with current tools, is difficult to observe experts as a means of acquiring search expertise in a scalable fashion. This calls for a redesign of computer-mediated communication tools to make individual search strategies visible to other users. I present a research agenda to investigate this claim, which draws upon theories of social learning. I use design-based research to build novel systems that enable imitation-based learning of search expertise.

DE Spam Filtering; Lam%; Measurement
AB Logistic average misclassification percentage (lam%) is a key measure for the spam filtering performance. This paper demonstrates that a spam filter can achieve a perfect 0.00% in lam%, the minimal value in theory, by simply setting a biased threshold during the classifier modeling. At the same time, the overall classification performance reaches only a low accuracy. The result suggests that the role of lam% for spam filtering evaluation should be re-examined.

A combination scheme to interpolate the link translation model with retrieval based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation. On the CLEF 2000 data we achieve improvement with respect to the best German-English system at the bilingual track (non-significant) and improvement against a baseline based on machine translation (significant).

DE Semantic-theme-based video retrieval; video-level retrieval; query
   expansion; concept-based video indexing; query performance prediction
AB In this paper we present a novel approach to semantic-theme-based video retrieval that considers entire videos as retrieval units and exploits automatically detected visual concepts to improve the results of retrieval based on spoken content. We deploy a query prediction method that makes use of a coherence indicator calculated on top returned documents and taking into account the information about visual concepts presence in videos to make a choice between query expansion methods. The main contribution of our approach is in its ability to exploit noisy shot-level concept detection to improve semantic-theme-based video retrieval. Strikingly, improvement is possible using an extremely limited set of concepts. In the experiments performed on TRECVID 2007 and 2008 datasets our approach shows an interesting performance improvement compared to the best performing baseline.

DE Blog feed search; two-stage model
AB We consider blog feed search: identifying relevant blogs for a given topic. An individual's search behavior often involves a combination of exploratory behavior triggered by salient features of the information objects being examined plus goal-directed in-depth information seeking behavior. We present a two-stage blog feed search model that directly builds on this insight. We first rank blog posts for a given topic, and use their parent blogs as selection of blogs that we rank using a blog-based model.

AB This paper proposes Multiclass VisualRank, a method that expands the idea of VisualRank into more than one category of images. Multiclass VisualRank divides images retrieved from search engines into several categories based on distinctive patterns of visual features, and gives ranking within the category. Experimental results show that our method can extract several different image categories relevant to given keyword and gives good ranking scores to retrieved images.

DE Efficiency; Filtering; FPGA
AB Processing large volumes of information generally requires massive amounts of computational power, which consumes a significant amount of energy. An emerging challenge is the development of "environmentally friendly" systems that are not only efficient in terms of time, but also energy efficient. In this poster, we outline our initial efforts at developing greener filtering systems by employing Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) to perform the core information processing task. FPGAs enable code to be executed in parallel at a chip level, while consuming only a fraction of the power of a standard (von Neuman style) processor. On a number of test collections, we demonstrate that the FPGA filtering system performs 10-20 times faster than the Itanium based implementation, resulting in considerable energy savings.

DE Network Science; World Wide Web
AB Highly interconnected networks with amazingly complex topology describe systems as diverse as the World Wide Web, our cells, social systems or the economy. Recent studies indicate that these networks are the result of self-organizing processes governed by simple but generic laws, resulting in architectural features that makes them much more similar to each other than one would have expected by chance. I will discuss the amazing order characterizing our interconnected world and its implications to network robustness and spreading processes. Finally, most of these networks are driven by the temporal patterns characterizing human activity. I will use communication and web browsing data to show that there is deep order in the temporal domain of human dynamics, and discuss the different ways to understand and model the emerging patterns.

DE Information Retrieval; Constraints; Axioms
AB Recently, an inductive approach to modelling term-weighting function correctness has provided a number of axioms (constraints), to which all good term-weighting functions should adhere. These constraints have been shown to be theoretically and empirically sound in a number of works [2, 3, 1]. It has been shown that when a term-weighting function breaks one or more of the constraints, it typically indicates sub-optimality of that function. This elegant inductive approach may more accurately model the human process of determining the relevance a document. It is intuitive that a person's notion of relevance changes as terms that are either on or off-topic are encountered in a given document. Ultimately, it would be desirable to be able to mathematically determine the performance of term-weighting functions without the need for test collections.
   Many modern term-weighting functions do riot, satisfy the constraints in an unconditional manner [3]. However, the degree to which these functions violate the constraints has not been investigated. A comparison between weighting functions from this perspective may shed light on the poor performance of certain functions in certain settings. Moreover, if a correlation exists between performance and the number of violations, measuring the degree of violation could help more accurately predict how a certain scheme will perform on a given collection.

DE Document Clustering; K-tree; B-tree; Search Tree; k-means
AB We introduce K-tree in an information retrieval context. It is an efficient approximation of the k-means clustering algorithm. Unlike k-means it forms a hierarchy of clusters. It has been extended to address issues with sparse representations. We compare performance and quality to CLUTO using document collections. The K-tree has a low time complexity that is suitable for large document collections. This tree structure allows for efficient disk based implementations where space requirements exceed that of main memory.

DE Salton Award Lecture; information retrieval; human-computer interaction;
   interdisciplinary research; evaluation
AB Let me begin by saying how honored I am to receive the Gerard Salton Award from SIGIR. His pioneering work, including the vector space model, term weightings, relevance feedback, and the development and evaluation of automatic text retrieval systems, defined and shaped the field in important ways. I did not have many opportunities to interact directly with Gerry Salton, although our paths did cross in interesting ways. Shortly after I started working at Bell Labs, I was introduced to the field of information retrieval by Michael Lesk, who had worked with Gerry at Harvard in the mid-1960s to develop the original SMART system. The last conference at which I interacted with Gerry was not SIGIR or TREC, as one might expect, but rather CHI 1995, where he spoke at panel entitled, Browsing vs. search: Can we find a synergy?', a theme to which I return.

AB Retrieval systems for polyphonic music rely on the automatic estimation of similarity between two musical pieces. In the case of symbolic music, existing systems either consider a monophonic reduction based on melody or propose algorithms with high complexity. In this paper, we propose a new approach. Musical pieces axe represented as a sequence of chords which are estimated from groups of notes sounding at the same time. A root and a mode are associated to each chord. Local alignment is then applied for estimating a similarity score between these sequences. Experiments performed on MIDI files collected on the Internet show that the system proposed allows the retrieval of different versions of the same song.

DE Blog search; Opinion finding; Distribution fitting
AB Current blog opinion retrieval approaches cannot be applied if the topic relevance and opinion score distributions by rank are dissimilar. This problem severely limits the feasibility of these approaches. We propose to tackle this problem by fitting the distribution of opinion scores, which replaces the original topic relevance score distribution with the simulated one. Our proposed score distribution fitting method markedly enhances the feasibility of a state-of-the-art dictionary-based opinion retrieval approach. Evaluation on a standard TREC blog test collection shows significant improvements over high quality topic relevance baselines.

AB Recently a number of studies have demonstrated that search engine logfiles are an important resource to determine the relevance relation between URLs and query terms. We hypothesized that the queries associated with a URL could also be presented as useful URL metadata in a search engine result list, e.g. for helping to determine the semantic category of a URL. We evaluated this hypothesis by a classification experiment based on the DMOZ dataset. Our method can also annotate URLs that have no associated queries.

AB This paper addresses the blog distillation problem. That is, given a user query find the blogs most related to the query topic. We model the blogosphere as a single graph that includes extra information besides the content of the posts. By performing a random walk on this graph we extract most relevant blogs for each query. Our experiments on the TREC'07 data set show 15% improvement in MAP and 8% improvement in Precision@10 over the Language Modeling baseline.

DE Tag; Similarity; Vector space model; Open directory project; Web search
AB In this paper, we propose a novel approach for measuring similarity between web objects. Our similarity measure is defined based on the representation of a web object as a collection of tags. Precisely, we first construct a vector space in which multiple terms are mapped into a single dimension by using information available from Open Directory Project and Delicious.com. Then we position web objects in the vector space and apply the traditional cosine measure for similarity computation. We demonstrate that the proposed similarity computation method is able to overcome the limitation of traditional vector space approach while at the same time require less computational cost compares to LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing).

DE Expert Search; Document Search
AB Expert search systems often employ a document search component to identify on-topic documents, which are then used to identify people likely to have relevant expertise. This work investigates the impact of the retrieval effectiveness of the underlying document search component. It has been previously shown that applying techniques to the underlying document search component that normally improve the effectiveness of a document search engine also have a positive impact on the retrieval effectiveness of the expert search engine. In this work, we experiment with fictitious perfect document rankings, to attempt to identify an upper-bound in expert search system performance. Our surprising results infer that non-relevant documents can bring useful expertise evidence, and that removing these does not lead to an upper-bound in retrieval performance.

DE Intranet; Expert finding; click-through log data
AB The task in expert finding is to identify members of an organisation with relevant expertise on a given topic. Typically an expert search engine uses evidence from the authors of on-topic documents found in the organisation's intranet by search engines. The search result click-through behaviour of many intranet search engine users provides an additional source of evidence to identify topically-relevant documents, and via document authorship, experts. In this poster, we assess the usefulness of click-through log data for expert finding. We find that ranking authors based solely on the clicks their documents receive is reasonably effective at correctly identifying relevant experts. Moreover, we show that this evidence can successfully be integrated with an existing expert search engine to increase its retrieval effectiveness.

AB We present an efficient method for approximate search in a combination of several metric spaces - which are a generalization of low level image features - using an inverted index. Our approximation gives very high recall with subsecond response time on a real data set of one million images extracted from Flickr. We further exploit the inverted index to improve efficiency of the query processing by combining our search in metric features with search in associated textual metadata.

   Document Retrieval
AB Speech Retrieval systems utilize automatic speech recognition (ASR) to generate textual data for indexing. However, automatic transcriptions include errors, either because of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words or due to ASR inaccuracy. In this work, we address spoken information retrieval in Turkish, a morphologically rich language where OOV rates are high. We apply several techniques, such as using subword units and indexing alternative hypotheses, to cope with the OOV problem and ASR inaccuracy. Experiments are performed on our Turkish Broadcast News (BN) Corpus which also incorporates a spoken IR collection. Results indicate that word segmentation is quite useful but the efficiency of indexing alternative hypotheses depends on retrieval type.

ID INFORMATION-SEEKING; EXPLORATORY SEARCH
AB With the increasing importance of search systems on the web, there is a continuing push to design interfaces which are a better match with the kinds of real-world tasks in which users are engaged. In this paper, we consider how broad, complex search tasks may be supported via the search interface. In particular, we consider search tasks which may be composed of multiple aspects, or multiple related subtasks. For example, in decision making tasks the user may investigate multiple possible solutions before settling on a single, final solution, while other tasks, such as report writing, may involve searching on multiple interrelated topics. A search interface is presented which is designed to support such broad search tasks, allowing a user to create search aspects, each of which models an independent subtask of some larger task. The interface is built on the intuition that users should be able to structure their searching environment when engaged on complex search tasks, where the act of structuring and organization may aid the user in understanding his or her task. A user study was carried out which compared our aspectual interface to a standard web-search interface. The results suggest that an aspectual interface can aid users when engaged in broad search tasks where the search aspects must be identified during searching; for a task where search aspects were pre-defined, no advantage over the baseline was found. Results for a decision making task were less clear cut, but show some evidence for improved task performance.

DE Probabilistic counting; link analysis; PageRank
AB The AncestorRank algorithm calculates an authority score by using just one characteristic of the web graph-the number of ancestors per node. For scalability, we estimate the number of ancestors by using a probabilistic counting algorithm. We also consider the case in which ancestors which are closer to the node have more influence than those farther from the node. Thus we further apply a decay factor delta on the contributions from successively earlier ancestors. The resulting authority score is used in combination with a content-based ranking algorithm. Our experiments show that as long as delta is in the range of [0.1, 0.9], AncestorRank can greatly improve BM25 performance, and in our experiments is often better than PageRank.

DE Video indexing; concept detection; sparse representation
AB This poster introduces a novel concept-based video indexing approach. It is developed based on a rich set of base concepts, of which the models are available. Then, for a given concept with several labeled samples, we combine the base concepts to fit it and its model can thus be obtained accordingly. Empirical results demonstrate that this method can achieve great performance even with very limited labeled data. We have compared different representation approaches including both sparse and non-sparse methods. Our conclusion is that the sparse method will lead to much better performance.

DE Ad Search; Query Substitution; Temporal Similarity
AB Recently, information retrieval researchers have witnessed the increasing interest in query substitution for ad search. Most previous works substitute search queries via content based query similarities, and few of them take the temporal characteristics of queries into consideration. In this extended abstract, we propose a novel temporal similarity measurement for query substitution in ad search task. We firstly extract temporal features, such as burst and periodicity, from query frequency curves and then define the temporal query similarity by integrating these new features with the temporal query frequency distribution. Compared to the traditional temporal similarity measurements such as correlation coefficient, our proposed approach is more effective owing to the explicit extraction of high-level semantic query temporal features for similarity measure. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed similarity measure can make the ads more relevant to user search queries compared to ad search without temporal features.

ID SEMANTIC SIMILARITY
AB One of the central tasks of R&D strategy and portfolio management at large technology companies and research institutions refers to the identification of technological synergies throughout the organization. These efforts are geared towards saving resources by consolidating scattered expertise, sharing best practices, and reusing available technologies across multiple product lines. In the past, this task has been done in a manual evaluation process by technical domain experts. While feasible, the major drawback of this approach is the enormous effort in terms of availability and time: For a structured and complete analysis every combination of any two technologies has to be rated explicitly. We present a novel approach that recommends technological synergies in an automated fashion, making use of abundant collective wisdom from the Web, both in pure textual form as well as classification ontologies. Our method has been deployed for practical support of the synergy evaluation process within our company. We have also conducted empirical evaluations based on randomly selected technology pairs so as to benchmark the accuracy of our approach, as compared to a group of general computer science technologists as well as a control group of domain experts.

DE Logical Imaging; Probability kinematics
AB Retrieval with Logical Imaging is derived from belief revision and provides a novel mechanism for estimating the relevance of a document through logical implication (i.e. P(q --> d)). In this poster, we perform the first comprehensive evaluation of Logical Imaging (LI) in Information Retrieval (IR) across several TREC test Collections. When compared against standard baseline models, we show that LI fails to improve performance. This failure can be attributed to a nuance within the model that means non-relevant documents are promoted in the ranking, while relevant documents are demoted. This is an important contribution because it not only contextualizes the effectiveness of LI, but crucially explains why it fails. By addressing this nuance, future LI models could be significantly improved.

DE Graph streams; Social streams
AB Many streaming applications in social networks, communication networks, and information networks are built on top of large graphs Such large networks contain continuously occurring processes, which lead to streams of edge interactions and posts. For example, the messages sent by participants on Facebook to one another can be viewed as content-rich interactions along edges. Such edge-centric streams are referred to as graph streams or social streams. The aggregate volume of these interactions can scale up super-linearly with the number of nodes in the network, which makes the problem more pressing for rapidly growing networks. These continuous streams may be mined for useful insights. In these cases, real-time analysis is crucial because of the time-sensitive nature of the interactions. However, generalizing conventional mining applications to such graphs turns out to be a challenge because of the expensive nature of graph mining algorithms. We discuss recent advances in several graph mining applications like clustering, classification, link prediction, event detection, and anomaly detection in real-time graph streams.

AB Sarcasm detection from text has gained increasing attention. While one thread of research has emphasized the importance of affective content in sarcasm detection, another avenue of research has explored the effectiveness of word representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel model for automated sarcasm detection in text, called Affective Word Embeddings for Sarcasm (AWES), which incorporates affective information into word representations. Extensive evaluation on sarcasm detection on six datasets across three domains of text (tweets, reviews and forum posts) demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model. The experimental results indicate that while sentiment affective representations yield best results on datasets comprising of short length text such as tweets, richer representations derived from fine-grained emotions are more suitable for detecting sarcasm from longer length documents such as product reviews and discussion forum posts.

AB Modern web search engines exploit users' search history to personalize search results, with a goal of improving their service utility on a per-user basis. But it is this very dimension that leads to the risk of privacy infringement and raises serious public concerns. In this work, we propose a client-centered intent-aware query obfuscation solution for protecting user privacy in a personalized web search scenario. In our solution, each user query is submitted with l additional cover queries and corresponding clicks, which act as decoys to mask users' genuine search intent from a search engine. The cover queries are sequentially sampled from a set of hierarchically organized language models to ensure the coherency of fake search intents in a cover search task. Our approach emphasizes the plausibility of generated cover queries, not only to the current genuine query but also to previous queries in the same task, to increase the complexity for a search engine to identify a user's true intent. We also develop two new metrics from an information theoretic perspective to evaluate the effectiveness of provided privacy protection. Comprehensive experiment comparisons with state-of-the-art query obfuscation techniques are performed on the public AOL search log, and the propitious results substantiate the effectiveness of our solution.

DE Learning to rank; propensity estimation; inverse propensity weighting
AB Learning to rank with biased click data is a well-known challenge. A variety of methods has been explored to debias click data for learning to rank such as click models, result interleaving and, more recently, the unbiased learning-to-rank framework based on inverse propensity weighting. Despite their differences, most existing studies separate the estimation of click bias (namely the propensity model) from the learning of ranking algorithms. To estimate click propensities, they either conduct online result randomization, which can negatively affect the user experience, or offline parameter estimation, which has special requirements for click data and is optimized for objectives (e.g. click likelihood) that are not directly related to the ranking performance of the system. In this work, we address those problems by unifying the learning of propensity models and ranking models. We find that the problem of estimating a propensity model from click data is a dual problem of unbiased learning to rank. Based on this observation, we propose a Dual Learning Algorithm (DLA) that jointly learns an unbiased ranker and an unbiased propensity model. DLA is an automatic unbiased learning-to-rank framework as it directly learns unbiased ranking models from biased click data without any preprocessing. It can adapt to the change of bias distributions and is applicable to online learning. Our empirical experiments with synthetic and real-world data show that the models trained with DLA significantly outperformed the unbiased learning-to-rank algorithms based on result randomization and the models trained with relevance signals extracted by click models.

AB Social data is a rich data source for identifying trends and topics of interest based on user activity. Social data also provides opportunities to collect numerical data about events like elections, sport games, disasters or economic news. We propose the problem of identifying relevant quantitative information from social data as annotations for a topic. We investigate how to extract quantitative information and perform a number of experiments and analysis with Twitter data.

AB Content-Based Image Retrieval in large archives through the use of visual features has become a very attractive research topic in recent years. The cause of this strong impulse in this area of research is certainly to be attributed to the use of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) activations as features and their outstanding performance. However, practically all the available image retrieval systems are implemented in main memory, limiting their applicability and preventing their usage in big-data applications. In this paper, we propose to transform CNN features into textual representations and index them with the well-known full-text retrieval engine Elasticsearch. We validate our approach on a novel CNN feature, namely Regional Maximum Activations of Convolutions. A preliminary experimental evaluation, conducted on the standard benchmark INRIA Holidays, shows the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach and how it compares to state-of-the-art main-memory indexes.

DE Sentiment; Aspect; Feature evaluation; Contradiction intensity
AB Reviews on web resources (e.g. courses, movies) become increasingly exploited in text analysis tasks (e.g. opinion detection, controversy detection). This paper investigates contradiction intensity in reviews exploiting different features such as variation of ratings and variation of polarities around specific entities (e.g. aspects, topics). Firstly, aspects are identified according to the distributions of the emotional terms in the vicinity of the most frequent nouns in the reviews collection. Secondly, the polarity of each review segment containing an aspect is estimated. Only resources containing these aspects with opposite polarities are considered. Finally, some features are evaluated, using feature selection algorithms, to determine their impact on the effectiveness of contradiction intensity detection. The selected features are used to learn some state-ofthe-art learning approaches. The experiments are conducted on the Massive Open Online Courses data set containing 2244 courses and their 73,873 reviews, collected from coursera.org . Results showed that variation of ratings, variation of polarities, and reviews quantity are the best predictors of contradiction intensity. Also, J48 was the most effective learning approach for this type of classification.

DE Algorithmic Fairness; Fair Ranking; Position Bias; Exposure
AB Rankings of people and items are at the heart of selection-making, match-making, and recommender systems, ranging from employment sites to sharing economy platforms. As ranking positions influence the amount of attention the ranked subjects receive, biases in rankings can lead to unfair distribution of opportunities and resources such as jobs or income.
   This paper proposes new measures and mechanisms to quantify and mitigate unfairness from a bias inherent to all rankings, namely, the position bias which leads to disproportionately less attention being paid to low-ranked subjects. Our approach differs from recent fair ranking approaches in two important ways. First, existing works measure unfairness at the level of subject groups while our measures capture unfairness at the level of individual subjects, and as such subsume group unfairness. Second, as no single ranking can achieve individual attention fairness, we propose a novel mechanism that achieves amortized fairness, where attention accumulated across a series of rankings is proportional to accumulated relevance.
   We formulate the challenge of achieving amortized individual fairness subject to constraints on ranking quality as an online optimization problem and show that it can be solved as an integer linear program. Our experimental evaluation reveals that unfair attention distribution in rankings can be substantial, and demonstrates that our method can improve individual fairness while retaining high ranking quality.

AB Does this sentence need citation? In this paper, we introduce the task of citation worthiness for scientific texts at a sentence-level granularity. The task is to detect whether a sentence in a scientific article needs to be cited or not. It can be incorporated into citation recommendation systems to help automate the citation process by marking sentences where needed. It may also be useful for publishers to regularize the citation process. We construct a dataset using the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus; consisting of over 1.1M "not_cite" and 85K "cite" sentences. We study the performance of a set of state-of-the-art sentence classifiers for the citation worthiness task and show the practical challenges. We also explore sectionwise difficulty of the task and analyze the performance of our best model on a published article.

DE Click model; User behavior; Web search
AB Getting a better understanding of user behavior is important for advancing information retrieval systems. Existing work focuses on modeling and predicting single interaction events, such as clicks. In this paper, we for the first time focus on modeling and predicting sequences of interaction events. And in particular, sequences of clicks.
   We formulate the problem of click sequence prediction and propose a click sequence model (CSM) that aims to predict the order in which a user will interact with search engine results. CSM is based on a neural network that follows the encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder computes contextual embeddings of the results. The decoder predicts the sequence of positions of the clicked results. It uses an attention mechanism to extract necessary information about the results at each timestep. We optimize the parameters of CSM by maximizing the likelihood of observed click sequences.
   We test the effectiveness of CSM on three new tasks: (i) predicting click sequences, (ii) predicting the number of clicks, and (iii) predicting whether or not a user will interact with the results in the order these results are presented on a search engine result page (SERP). Also, we show that CSM achieves state-of-the-art results on a standard click prediction task, where the goal is to predict an unordered set of results a user will click on.

ID CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK; COMPLEXITY
AB An important area of IR research involves understanding how task characteristics influence search behaviors and outcomes. Task complexity is one characteristic that has received considerable attention. One view of task complexity is through the lens of a priori determinability-the level of uncertainty about task outcomes and processes experienced by the searcher. In this work, we manipulated the determinability of comparative tasks. Our task manipulation involved modifying the scope of the task by specifying exact items and/or exact (objective or subjective) dimensions to consider as part of the task. This paper reports on a within-subject study (N = 144) where we investigated how our task manipulation influenced participants' perceptions, levels of engagement, search effort, and choice of search strategies. Our results suggest a complex relationship between task scope, determinability, and different outcome measures. Our most open-ended tasks were perceived to have low determinability (high uncertainty), but were the least challenging for participants due to satisficing. Furthermore, narrowing the scope of tasks by specifying items had a different effect than by specifying dimensions. Specifying items increased the task determinability (lower uncertainty) and made the task easier, while specifying dimensions did not increase the task determinability and made the task more challenging. A qualitative analysis of participants' queries suggests that searching for dimensions is more challenging than for items. Finally, we observed subtle differences between objective and subjective dimensions. We discuss implications for the design of IIR studies and tools to support users.

DE Measurement; Performance; Experimentation
AB We investigate the use of logged user interaction data-queries and clicks-for offline evaluation of new search systems in the context of counterfactual analysis. The challenge of evaluating a new ranker against log data collected from a static production ranker is that new rankers may retrieve documents that have never been seen in the logs before, and thus lack any logged feedback from users. Additionally, the ranker itself could bias user actions such that even documents that have been seen in the logs would have exhibited different interaction patterns had they been retrieved and ranked by the new ranker. We present a methodology for incrementally logging interactions on previously-unseen documents for use in computation of an unbiased estimator of a new ranker's effectiveness. Our method is very lightly invasive with respect to the production ranker results to insure against users becoming dissatisfied if the new ranker is poor. We demonstrate how well our methods work in a simulation environment designed to be challenging for such methods to argue that they are likely to work in a wide variety of scenarios.

AB Designing powerful tools that support cooking activities has rapidly gained popularity due to the massive amounts of available data, as well as recent advances in machine learning that are capable of analyzing them. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal retrieval model aligning visual and textual data (like pictures of dishes and their recipes) in a shared representation space. We describe an effective learning scheme, capable of tackling large-scale problems, and validate it on the Recipe1M dataset containing nearly 1 million picture-recipe pairs. We show the effectiveness of our approach regarding previous state-of-the-art models and present qualitative results over computational cooking use cases.

AB With an ever increasing amount of data available on the web, fast similarity search has become the critical component for large-scale information retrieval systems. One solution is semantic hashing which designs binary codes to accelerate similarity search. Recently, deep learning has been successfully applied to the semantic hashing problem and produces high-quality compact binary codes compared to traditional methods. However, most state-of-the-art semantic hashing approaches require large amounts of hand-labeled training data which are often expensive and time consuming to collect. The cost of getting labeled data is the key bottleneck in deploying these hashing methods. Motivated by the recent success in machine learning that makes use of weak supervision, we employ unsupervised ranking methods such as BM25 to extract weak signals from training data. We further introduce two deep generative semantic hashing models to leverage weak signals for text hashing. The experimental results on four public datasets show that our models can generate high-quality binary codes without using hand-labeled training data and significantly outperform the competitive unsupervised semantic hashing baselines.

AB Systems for structured knowledge extraction and inference have made giant strides in the last decade. Starting from shallow linguistic tagging and coarse-grained recognition of named entities at the resolution of people, places, organizations, and times, modern systems link billions of pages of unstructured text with knowledge graphs having hundreds of millions of entities belonging to tens of thousands of types, and related by tens of thousands of relations. Via deep learning, systems build continuous representations of words, entities, types, and relations, and use these to continually discover new facts to add to the knowledge graph, and support search systems that go far beyond page-level "ten blue links". We will present a comprehensive catalog of the best practices in traditional and deep knowledge extraction, inference and search. We will trace the development of diverse families of techniques, explore their interrelationships, and point out various loose ends.

AB The large scale of scholarly publications poses a challenge for scholars in information seeking and sensemaking. Information retrieval (IR), bibliometric and natural language processing (NLP) techniques could enhance scholarly search, retrieval and user experience but are not yet widely used. To this purpose, we propose the third iteration of the Joint Workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing for Digital Libraries (BIRNDL) [1, 3]. The workshop is intended to stimulate IR, NLP researchers and Digital Library professionals to elaborate on new approaches in natural language processing, information retrieval, scientometrics, text mining and recommendation techniques that can advance the state-of-the-art in scholarly document understanding, analysis, and retrieval at scale. The BIRNDL workshop will incorporate multiple invited talks, paper sessions, a poster session and the 4th edition of the Computational Linguistics (CL) Scientific Summarization Shared Task.

DE Neural methods for information retrieval; Query suggestion
AB Query suggestions help users of a search engine to refine their queries. Previous work on query suggestion has mainly focused on incorporating directly observable features such as query co-occurrence and semantic similarity. The structure of such features is often set manually, as a result of which hidden dependencies between queries and users may be ignored. We propose an Attention-based Hierarchical Neural Query Suggestion (AHNQS) model that combines a hierarchical structure with a session-level neural network and a user-level neural network to model the short- and long-term search history of a user. An attention mechanism is used to capture user preferences. We quantify the improvements of AHNQS over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network-based query suggestion baselines on the AOL query log dataset, with improvements of up to 21.86% and 22.99% in terms of MRR@10 and Recall@10, respectively, over the state-of-the-art; improvements are especially large for short sessions.

AB The snippets in the result list of a web search engine are built with sentences from the retrieved web pages that match the query. Reusing a web page's text for snippets has been considered fair use under the copyright laws of most jurisdictions. As of recent, notable exceptions from this arrangement include Germany and Spain, where news publishers are entitled to raise claims under a so-called ancillary copyright. A similar legislation is currently discussed at the European Commission. If this development gains momentum, the reuse of text for snippets will soon incur costs, which in turn will give rise to new solutions for generating truly original snippets. A key question in this regard is whether the users will accept any new approach for snippet generation, or whether they will prefer the current model of "reuse snippets." The paper in hand gives a first answer. A crowdsourcing experiment along with a statistical analysis reveals that our test users exert no significant preference for either kind of snippet. Notwithstanding the technological difficulty, this result opens the door to a new snippet synthesis paradigm.

DE Dialogue Act Recognition; Conditional Random Field; Structured Attention
   Network
AB Dialogue Act Recognition (DAR) is a challenging problem in dialogue interpretation, which aims to associate semantic labels to utterances and characterize the speaker's intention. Currently, many existing approaches formulate the DAR problem ranging from multi-classification to structured prediction, which suffer from hand-crafted feature extensions and attentive contextual dependencies. In this paper, we tackle the problem of DAR from the viewpoint of extending richer Conditional Random Field (CRF) structured dependencies without abandoning end-to-end training. We incorporate hierarchical semantic inference with memory mechanism on the utterance modeling at multiple levels. We then utilize the structured attention network on the linear-chain CRF to dynamically separate the utterances into cliques. The extensive experiments on two primary benchmark datasets Switchboard Dialogue Act (SWDA) and Meeting Recorder Dialogue Act (MRDA) datasets show that our method achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art solutions to the problem.

AB Tag-based Social Image Retrieval (TAGIR) aims to find relevant social images using keyword queries. State-of-the-art TAGIR techniques typically rank query results based on relevance, temporal or popularity criteria. However, these criteria may not always be sufficient to match diverse search intents of users. In this paper, we present a novel ranking scheme that ranks query results (images) based on their historical relevance. Informally, an image is historically relevant if its visual content is relevant to the query and it depicts objects, scenes, or events that are related to human history. To this end, we propose a learning-agnostic technique that leverages Wikipedia to quantify historical relevance of images. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our ranking scheme using Flickr dataset.

AB Query performance prediction (QPP) aims at automatically estimating the information retrieval system effectiveness for any user's query. Previous work has investigated several types of pre- and post-retrieval query performance predictors; the latter has been shown to be more effective. In this paper we investigate the use of features that were initially defined for learning to rank in the task of QPP. While these features have been shown to be useful for learning to rank documents, they have never been studied as query performance predictors. We developed more than 350 variants of them based on summary functions. Conducting experiments on four TREC standard collections, we found that Letor-based features appear to be better QPP than predictors from the literature. Moreover, we show that combining the best Letor features outperforms the state of the art query performance predictors. This is the first study that considers such an amount and variety of Letor features for QPP and that demonstrates they are appropriate for this task.

AB In this talk, we would like to highlight some interesting challenges faced when trying to build a large-scale commercial IR-based chatbot, Ruuh(1), for an emerging market like India which has unique characterisitcs such as high linguistic and cultural diversity, large section of young population and the second largest mobile market in the world. We set out to build a "human-like" AI agent which aspires to become the trusted BFF of every Indian youth. To meet this objective, we realized that we need to think beyond the utilitarian notion of merely generating "relevant" responses and enable the agent to comprehend and meet a wider range of user social needs, like expressing happiness when user's favorite team wins, sharing a cute comment on showing the pictures of the user's pet and so on. The agent should also be well-versed with the informal language of the urban Indian youth which often includes slang and code-mixing across two or more languages. Finally, in order to be their trusted friend, the agent has to communicate with respect without offending their sentiments and emotions. Some of the above objectives pose significant research challenges in the areas of NLP, IR and AI. We intend to take the audience through our journey of how we tackled some of the above challenges while building a large-scale commercial IR-based conversational agent. Our attempts to solve some of the above challenges have also resulted in some interesting research contributions in the form of publications and patents in the above areas. Our chat-bot currently has more than 1M users who have engaged in more than 70M conversations.

AB Unlike traditional learning to rank models that depend on hand-crafted features, neural representation learning models learn higher level features for the ranking task by training on large datasets. Their ability to learn new features directly from the data, however, may come at a price. Without any special supervision, these models learn relationships that may hold only in the domain from which the training data is sampled, and generalize poorly to domains not observed during training. We study the effectiveness of adversarial learning as a cross domain regularizer in the context of the ranking task. We use an adversarial discriminator and train our neural ranking model on a small set of domains. The discriminator provides a negative feedback signal to discourage the model from learning domain specific representations. Our experiments show consistently better performance on held out domains in the presence of the adversarial discriminator-sometimes up to 30% on precision@1.

AB With the rise in mobile and voice search, answer passage retrieval acts as a critical component of an effective information retrieval system for open domain question answering. Currently, there are no comparable collections that address non-factoid question answering within larger documents while simultaneously providing enough examples sufficient to train a deep neural network. In this paper, we introduce a new Wikipedia based collection specific for non-factoid answer passage retrieval containing thousands of questions with annotated answers and show benchmark results on a variety of state of the art neural architectures and retrieval models. The experimental results demonstrate the unique challenges presented by answer passage retrieval within topically relevant documents for future research.

AB Dynamic Sampling is a novel, non-uniform, statistical sampling strategy in which documents are selected for relevance assessment based on the results of prior assessments. Unlike static and dynamic pooling methods that are commonly used to compile relevance assessments for the creation of information retrieval test collections, Dynamic Sampling yields a statistical sample from which substantially unbiased estimates of effectiveness measures may be derived. In contrast to static sampling strategies, which make no use of relevance assessments, Dynamic Sampling is able to select documents from a much larger universe, yielding superior test collections for a given budget of relevance assessments. These assertions are supported by simulation studies using secondary data from the TREC 2017 Common Core Track.

AB Conversational search and recommendation systems that use natural language interfaces are an increasingly important area raising a number of research and interface design questions. Despite the increasing popularity of digital personal assistants, the number of conversational recommendation systems is limited and their functionality basic. In this demonstration we introduce Vote Goat, a conversational recommendation agent built using Google's DialogFlow framework. The demonstration provides an interactive movie recommendation system using a speech-based natural language interface. The main intents span search and recommendation tasks including: rating movies, receiving recommendations, retrieval over movie metadata, and viewing crowdsourced statistics. Vote Goat uses gamification to incentivize movie voting interactions with the 'Greatest Of All Time' (GOAT) movies derived from user ratings. The demo includes important functionality for research applications with logging of interactions for building test collections as well as A/B testing to allow researchers to experiment with system parameters.

DE eCommerce; Product Search; Recommendation
AB eCommerce Information Retrieval has received little attention in the academic literature, yet it is an essential component of some of the largest web sites (such as eBay, Amazon, Airbnb, Alibaba, Taobao, Target, Facebook, and others). SIGIR has for several years seen sponsorship from these kinds of organisations, who clearly value the importance of research into Information Retrieval. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners of eCommerce IR to discuss topics unique to it, to set a research agenda, and to examine how to build datasets for research into this fascinating topic.
   eCommerce IR is ripe for research and has a unique set of problems. For example, in eCommerce search there may be no hypertext links between documents (products); there is a click stream, but more importantly, there is often a buy stream. eCommerce problems are wide in scope and range from user interaction modalities (the kinds of search seen in when buying are different from those of web-page search (i.e. it is not clear how shopping and buying relate to the standard web-search interaction models)) through to dynamic updates of a rapidly changing collection on auction sites, and the experienceness of some products (such as Airbnb bookings).
   This workshop is a follow up to the "SIGIR 2017 workshop on eCommerce (ECOM17)", which was organized at SIGIR 2017, Tokyo. In the 2018 workshop, in addition to a data challenge, we will be following up on multiple aspects that were discussed in the 2017 workshop.

DE Click Prediction; LSTM-RNN; Externality
AB Ad click prediction is a task to estimate the click-through rate (CTR) in sponsored ads, the accuracy of which impacts user search experience and businesses' revenue. State-of-the-art sponsored search systems typically model it as a classification problem and employ machine learning approaches to predict the CTR per ad. In this paper, we propose a new approach to predict ad CTR in sequence which considers user browsing behavior and the impact of top ads quality to the current one. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in the literature to predict ad CTR by using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. The proposed model is evaluated on a real dataset and we show that LSTM-RNN outperforms DNN model on both AUC and RIG. Since the RNN inference is time consuming, a simplified version is also proposed, which can achieve more than half of the gain with the overall serving cost almost unchanged.

AB Semantic technologies such as controlled vocabularies, thesauri, and knowledge graphs have been used throughout the history of information retrieval for a variety of tasks. Recent advances in knowledge acquisition, alignment, and utilization have given rise to a body of new approaches for utilizing knowledge graphs in text retrieval tasks and it is therefore time to consolidate the community efforts and study how such technologies can be employed in information retrieval systems in the most effective way. It is also time to start and deepen the dialogue between researchers and practitioners in order to ensure that breakthroughs, technologies, and algorithms in this space are widely disseminated. The goal of this workshop is to bring together and grow a community of researchers and practitioners who are interested in using, aligning, and constructing knowledge graphs and similar semantic resources for information retrieval applications.

   Network; Attention Mechanism
AB Search task identification aims to understand a user's information needs to improve search quality for applications such as query suggestion, personalized search, and advertisement retrieval. To properly identify the search task within long query sessions, it is important to partition these sessions into segments before further processing. In this paper, we present the first search session segmentation model that uses a long short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism. This model considers sequential context knowledge, including temporal information, word and character, and essentially learns which parts of the input query sequence are relevant to the current segmentation task and determines the influence of these parts. This segmentation technique is also combined with an efficient clustering method using a novel query relevance metric for end-to-end search task identification. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our segmentation technique improves task identification accuracy of existing clustering-based algorithms.

DE sentiment analysis; memory network; convolutional operation
AB Memory networks have shown expressive performance on aspect based sentiment analysis. However, ordinary memory networks only capture word-level information and lack the capacity for modeling complicated expressions which consist of multiple words. Targeting this problem, we propose a novel convolutional memory network which incorporates an attention mechanism. This model sequentially computes the weights of multiple memory units corresponding to multi-words. This model may capture both words and multi-words expressions in sentences for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

AB Mobile devices are pervasive, which means that users have access to web content and their personal documents at all locations, not just their home or office. Existing work has studied how locations can influence information needs, focusing on web queries. We explore whether or not location information can be helpful to users who are searching their own personal documents.
   We wish to study whether a users' location can predict their queries over their own personal data, so we focus on the task of query suggestion. While we find that using location directly can be helpful, it does not generalize well to novel locations. To improve this situation, we explore using semantic location: that is, rather than memorizing location-query associations, we generalize our location information to names of the closest point of interest. By using short, semantic descriptions of locations, we find that we can more robustly improve query completion and observe that users are already using locations to extend their own queries in this domain.
   We present a simple but effective model that can use location to predict queries for a user even before they type anything into a search box, and which learns effectively even when not all queries have location information.

DE dyslexia; readability; web search
AB Standards organizations, (e.g., the World Wide Web Consortium), are placing increased importance on the cognitive accessibility of online systems, including web search. Previous work has shown an association between query-document relevance judgments, and query-independent assessments of document readability. In this paper we study the lexical and aesthetic features of web documents that may underlie this relationship. Leveraging a data set consisting of relevance and readability judgments for 200 web pages as assessed by 174 adults with dyslexia and 172 adults without dyslexia, we answer the following research questions: (1) Which web page features are most associated with readability? (2) To what extent are these features also associated with relevance? And, (3) are any features associated with the differences in readability/relevance judgments observed between dyslexic and non-dyslexic populations? Our findings have implications for improving the cognitive accessibility of search systems and web documents.

AB We study the use and evaluation of a system for supporting music discovery, the experience of finding and listening to content previously unknown to the user. We adopt a mixed methods approach, including interviews, unsupervised learning, survey research, and statistical modeling, to understand and evaluate user satisfaction in the context of discovery. User interviews and survey data show that users' behaviors change according to their goals, such as listening to recommended tracks in the moment, or using recommendations as a starting point for exploration. We use these findings to develop a statistical model of user satisfaction at scale from interactions with a music streaming platform. We show that capturing users' goals, their deviations from their usual behavior, and their peak interactions on individual tracks are informative for estimating user satisfaction. Finally, we present and validate heuristic metrics that are grounded in user experience for online evaluation of recommendation performance. Our findings, supported with evidence from both qualitative and quantitative studies, reveal new insights about user expectations with discovery and their behavioral responses to satisfying and dissatisfying systems.

AB Rapid expansion of mobile devices has brought an unprecedented opportunity for mobile operators and content publishers to reach many users at any point in time. Understanding usage patterns of mobile applications (apps) is an integral task that precedes advertising efforts of providing relevant recommendations to users. However, this task can be very arduous due to the unstructured nature of app data, with sparseness in available information. This study proposes a novel approach to learn representations of mobile user actions using Deep Memory Networks. We validate the proposed approach on millions of app usage sessions built from large scale feeds of mobile app events and mobile purchase receipts. The empirical study demonstrates that the proposed approach performed better compared to several competitive baselines in terms of recommendation precision quality. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study analyzing app usage patterns for purchase recommendation.

AB For many queries in the Web retrieval setting there is an on-going ranking competition: authors manipulate their documents so as to promote them in rankings. Such competitions can have unwarranted effects not only in terms of retrieval effectiveness, but also in terms of ranking robustness. A case in point, rankings can (rapidly) change due to small indiscernible perturbations of documents. While there has been a recent growing interest in analyzing the robustness of classifiers to adversarial manipulations, there has not yet been a study of the robustness of relevance-ranking functions. We address this challenge by formally analyzing different definitions and aspects of the robustness of learning-to-rank-based ranking functions. For example, we formally show that increased regularization of linear ranking functions increases ranking robustness. This finding leads us to conjecture that decreased variance of any ranking function results in increased robustness. We propose several measures for quantifying ranking robustness and use them to analyze ranking competitions between documents' authors. The empirical findings support our formal analysis and conjecture for both RankSVM and LambdaMART.

AB We present a broad overview of personalized content recommendations at Twitter, discussing how our approach has evolved over the years, represented by several generations of systems. Historically, content analysis of Tweets has not been a priority, and instead engineering efforts have focused on graph-based recommendation techniques that exploit structural properties of the follow graph and engagement signals from users. These represent "low hanging fruits" that have enabled high-quality recommendations using simple algorithms. As deployed systems have grown in maturity and our understanding of the problem space has become more refined, we have begun to look for other opportunities to further improve recommendation quality. We overview recent investments in content analysis, particularly named-entity recognition techniques built around recurrent neural networks, and discuss how they integrate with existing graph-based capabilities to open up the design space of content recommendation algorithms.

DE Social Media; Real-time Adaptive Search; Crisis Management
AB The observation of social media provides an important complementing source of information about an unfolding event such as a crisis situation. For this purpose we have developed and demonstrate Sover!, (1) a system to monitor real-time dynamic events via Twitter targeting the needs of aid organizations. At its core it builds upon an effective adaptive crawler, which combines two social media streams in a Bayesian inference framework and after each time-window updates the probabilities of whether given keywords are relevant for an event. Sover! also exposes the crawling functionality so a user can actively influence the evolving selection of keywords. The crawling activity feeds a rich dashboard, which enables the user to get a better understanding of a crisis situation as it unfolds in real-time.

DE Entity resolution; knowledge graph; comparative table; multi-entity
   summarization; holistic property matching
AB Entity resolution (ER), the process of identifying entities that refer to the same real-world object, has long been studied in the knowledge graph (KG) community, among many others. Humans, as a valuable source of background knowledge, are increasingly getting involved in this loop by crowdsourcing and active learning, where presenting condensed and easily-compared information is vital to help human intervene in an ER task. However, current methods for single entity or pairwise summarization cannot well support humans to observe and compare multiple entities simultaneously, which impairs the efficiency and accuracy of human intervention. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to select a few important properties and values for a set of entities, and assemble them by a comparative table. We formulate several optimization problems for generating an optimal comparative table according to intuitive goodness measures and various constraints. Our experiments on real-world datasets, comparison with related work and user study demonstrate the superior efficiency, precision and user satisfaction of our approach in multi-entity resolution (MER).

DE Sequential recommendation; memory network; knowledge base
AB With the revival of neural networks, many studies try to adapt powerful sequential neural models, i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), to sequential recommendation. RNN-based networks encode historical interaction records into a hidden state vector. Although the state vector is able to encode sequential dependency, it still has limited representation power in capturing complicated user preference. It is difficult to capture fine-grained user preference from the interaction sequence. Furthermore, the latent vector representation is usually hard to understand and explain.
   To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel knowledge enhanced sequential recommender. Our model integrates the RNN-based networks with Key-Value Memory Network (KV-MN). We further incorporate knowledge base (KB) information to enhance the semantic representation of KV-MN. RNN-based models are good at capturing sequential user preference, while knowledge-enhanced KV-MNs are good at capturing attribute-level user preference. By using a hybrid of RNNs and KV-MNs, it is expected to be endowed with both benefits from these two components. The sequential preference representation together with the attribute-level preference representation are combined as the final representation of user preference. With the incorporation of KB information, our model is also highly interpretable. To our knowledge, it is the first time that sequential recommender is integrated with external memories by leveraging large-scale KB information.

AB Learning with pairwise ranking methods for implicit feedback datasets has shown promising results as compared to pointwise ranking methods for recommendation tasks. However, there is limited effort in scaling the pairwise ranking methods in a large scale distributed setting. In this paper we address the scalability aspect of a pairwise ranking method using Factorization Machines in distributed settings. Our proposed method is based on a block partitioning of the model parameters so that each distributed worker runs stochastic gradient updates on an independent block. We developed a dynamic block creation and exchange strategy by utilizing the frequency of occurrence of a feature in the local training data of a worker. Empirical evidence on publicly available benchmark datasets indicates that the proposed method scales better than the static block based methods and outperforms competing state-of-the-art methods.

AB In an era in which new controversies rapidly emerge and evolve on social media, navigating social media platforms to learn about a new controversy can be an overwhelming task. In this light, there has been significant work that studies how to identify and measure controversy online. However, we currently lack a tool for effectively understanding controversy in social media. For example, users have to manually examine postings to find the arguments of conflicting stances that make up the controversy.
   In this paper, we study methods to generate a stance-aware summary that explains a given controversy by collecting arguments of two conflicting stances. We focus on Twitter and treat stance summarization as a ranking problem of finding the top k tweets that best summarize the two conflicting stances of a controversial topic. We formalize the characteristics of a good stance summary and propose a ranking model accordingly. We first evaluate our methods on five controversial topics on Twitter. Our user evaluation shows that our methods consistently outperform other baseline techniques in generating a summary that explains the given controversy.

AB Tree-based ensembles are widely used for document ranking but supporting such a method efficiently under a privacy-preserving constraint on the cloud is an open research problem. The main challenge is that letting the cloud server perform ranking computation may unsafely reveal privacy-sensitive information. To address privacy with tree-based server-side ranking, this paper proposes to reduce the learning-to-rank model dependence on composite features as a trade-off, and develops comparison-preserving mapping to hide feature values and tree thresholds. To justify the above approach, the presented analysis shows that a decision tree with simplifiable composite features can be transformed into another tree using raw features without increasing the training accuracy loss. This paper analyzes the privacy properties of the proposed scheme, and compares the relevance of gradient boosting regression trees, LambdaMART, and random forests using raw features for several test data sets under the privacy consideration, and assesses the competitiveness of a hybrid model based on these algorithms.

AB In-  probabilistic BM25, term frequency normalization is one of the key components. It is often controlled by parameters k(1) and b, which need to be optimized for each given data set. In this paper, we assume and show empirically that term frequency normalization should be specific with query length in order to optimize retrieval performance. Following this intuition, we first propose a new term frequency normalization with query length for probabilistic information retrieval, namely BM25(QL). Then BM25(QL) is incorporated into the state-of-the-art models CRTER2 and LDA-BM25, denoted as CRTER2QL and LDA-BM25(QL) respectively. A series of experiments show that our proposed approaches BM25(QL), CRTER2QL and LDA-BM25(QL) are comparable to BM25, CRTER2 and LDA-BM25 with the optimal b setting in terms of MAP on all the data sets.

DE User identification; shared accounts; heterogeneous graph embedding;
   user session clustering; recommender systems
AB Online streaming services are prevalent. Major service providers, such as Netflix (for movies) and Spotify (for music), usually have a large customer base. More often than not, users may share an account. This has attracted increasing attention recently, as account sharing not only compromises the service provider's financial interests but also impairs the performance of recommendation systems and consequently the quality of service provided to the users.
   To address this issue, this paper focuses on the problem of user identification in shared accounts. Our goal is three-fold: (1) Given an account, along with its historical session logs, we identify a set of users who share such account; (2) Given a new session issued by an account, we find the corresponding user among the identified users of such account; (3) We aim to boost the performance of item recommendation by user identification. While the mapping between users and accounts is unknown, we propose an unsupervised learning-based framework, Session-based Heterogeneous graph Embedding for User Identification (SHE-UI), to differentiate and model the preferences of users in an account, and to group sessions by these users. In SHE-UI, a heterogeneous graph is constructed to represent items such as songs and their available metadata such as artists, genres, and albums. An item-based session embedding technique is proposed using a normalized random walk in the heterogeneous graph. Our experiments conducted on two large-scale music streaming datasets, Last.fm and KKBOX, show that SHE-UI not only accurately identifies users, but also significantly improves the performance of item recommendation over the state-of-the-art methods.

DE Citation Recommendation; Cross-language; Heterogeneous Graph;
   Representation Learning
AB While the volume of scholarly publications has increased at a frenetic pace, accessing and consuming the useful candidate papers, in very large digital libraries, is becoming an essential and challenging task for scholars. Unfortunately, because of language barrier, some scientists (especially the junior ones or graduate students who do not master other languages) cannot efficiently locate the publications hosted in a foreign language repository. In this study, we propose a novel solution, cross-language citation recommendation via Hierarchical Representation Learning on Heterogeneous Graph (HRLHG), to address this new problem. HRLHG can learn a representation function by mapping the publications, from multilingual repositories, to a low-dimensional joint embedding space from various kinds of vertexes and relations on a heterogeneous graph. By leveraging both global (task specific) plus local (task independent) information as well as a novel supervised hierarchical random walk algorithm, the proposed method can optimize the publication representations by maximizing the likelihood of locating the important cross-language neighborhoods on the graph. Experiment results show that the proposed method can not only outperform state-ofthe-art baseline models, but also improve the interpretability of the representation model for cross-language citation recommendation task.

AB We studied the volatility of commercial search engines and reflected on its impact on research that uses them as basis of algorithmical techniques or for user studies. Search engine volatility refers to the fact that a query posed to a search engine at two different points in time returns different documents.
   By comparing search results retrieved every 2 days over a period of 64 days, we found that the considered commercial search engine API consistently presented volatile search results: it both retrieved new documents, and it ranked documents previously retrieved at different ranks throughout time. Moreover, not only results are volatile: we also found that the effectiveness of the search engine in answering a query is volatile. Our findings reaffirmed that results from commercial search engines are volatile and that care should be taken when using these as basis for researching new information retrieval techniques or performing user studies.

AB NAVER, Korea's No. 1 internet company, and LINE, the Japan-based global messenger platform, have teamed up to use their extensive online content databases (documents, maps, encyclopedia, etc.) and user information to develop an AI platform called Clova (Cloudbased Virtual Assistant). Clova's deep-learning based methods have made tremendous progress in image classification and intelligent Q&A response. For example, in Naver, users can procure product or location information by showing pictures. Keyword-based matching is enhanced using semantic analysis, and retrieving top links is changed to answering questions by refining user queries through dialogue. In addition to PC and mobile, Clova is evolving to enable a user to access the relevant information using multiple devices and interfaces. Line released a smart speaker called Clova Friends that includes Line's free voice-call function and infrared home-appliance control. IPTV set-top box powered-by the Clova AI platform which can recommend movies based on Naver's user reviews. In this talk, I will cover some efforts and challenges in understanding and satisfying users on each device with sophisticated natural language processing technologies. I will introduce the technically challenging problems that we are currently tackling and future AI developments.

AB Online health communities have become a medium for patients to share their personal experiences and interact with peers on topics related to a disease, medication, side effects, and therapeutic processes. Analyzing informational posts in these communities can provide an insightful view about the dominant health issues and can help patients find the information that they need easier. In this paper, we propose a computational model that mines user content in online health communities to detect positive experiences and suggestions on health improvement as well as negative impacts or side effects that cause suffering throughout fighting with a disease. Specifically, we combine high-level, abstract features extracted from a convolutional neural network with lexicon-based features and features extracted from a long short term memory network to capture the semantics in the data. We show that our model, with and without lexicon-based features, outperforms strong baselines.

DE search; causal inference; social media; expectation exploration
AB Many people use web search engines for expectation exploration: exploring what might happen if they take some action, or how they should expect some situation to evolve. While search engines have databases to provide structured answers to many questions, there is no database about the outcomes of actions or the evolution of situations. The information we need to answer such questions, however, is already being recorded. On social media, for example, hundreds of millions of people are publicly reporting about the actions they take and the situations they are in, and an increasing range of events and activities experienced in their lives over time. In this presentation, we show how causal inference methods can be applied to such individual-level, longitudinal records to generate answers for expectation exploration queries.

AB Query suggestions are a standard means to clarify the intent of underspecified queries. In a voice-based search setting, the compilation of query suggestions is not straightforward, and user-centric research targeting query underspecification is lacking so far. Our paper analyses a specific type of ambiguous voice queries and studies the impact of various kinds of voice query clarifications offered by the system and its impact on user satisfaction. We conduct a user study that measures the satisfaction for clarifications that are explicitly invoked and presented by seven different methods. Our findings include that (1) user experience depends on language proficiency levels, (2) users are not dissatisfied when prompted for clarifications (in fact, enjoy it sometimes), and (3) the most effective way of query clarification depends on the number and lengths of the possible answers.

AB Fusion is an important and central concept in Information Retrieval. The goal of fusion methods is to merge different sources of information so as to address a retrieval task. For example, in the adhoc retrieval setting, fusion methods have been applied to merge multiple document lists retrieved for a query. The lists could be retrieved using different query representations, document representations, ranking functions and corpora. The goal of this half day, intermediate-level, tutorial is to provide a methodological view of the theoretical foundations of fusion approaches, the numerous fusion methods that have been devised and a variety of applications for which fusion techniques have been applied.

DE Document Ranking; Systematic Reviews; Seed Document
AB Systematic review (SR) in evidence-based medicine is a literature review which provides a conclusion to a specific clinical question. To assure credible and reproducible conclusions, SRs are conducted by well-defined steps. One of the key steps, the screening step, is to identify relevant documents from a pool of candidate documents. Typically about 2000 candidate documents will be retrieved from databases using keyword queries for a SR. From which, about 20 relevant documents are manually identified by SR experts, based on detailed relevance conditions or eligibility criteria. Recent studies show that document ranking, or screening prioritization, is a promising way to improve the manual screening process. In this paper, we propose a seed-driven document ranking (SDR) model for effective screening, with the assumption that one relevant document is known, i.e., the seed document. Based on a detailed analysis of characteristics of relevant documents, SDR represents documents using 'bag of clinical terms', rather than the commonly used bag of words. More importantly, we propose a method to estimate the importance of the clinical terms based on their distribution in candidate documents. On benchmark dataset released by CLEF'17 eHealth Task 2, we show that the proposed SDR outperforms stateof-the-art solutions. Interestingly, we also observe that ranking based on word embedding representation of documents well complements SDR. The best ranking is achieved by combining the relevances estimated by SDR and by word embedding. Additionally, we report results of simulating the manual screening process with SDR.

AB Application programming interface (API) documentation well describes an API and how to use it. However, official documentation does not describe "how not to use it" or the different kinds of errors when an API is used wrongly. Programming caveats are negative usages of an API. When these caveats are overlooked, errors may emerge, leading to heavy discussions on Q&A websites like Stack Overflow. In this demonstration, we present API Caveat Explorer, a search system to explore API caveats that are mined from large-scale unstructured discussions on Stack Overflow. API Caveat Explorer takes API-oriented queries such as "HashMap" and retrieves API caveats by text summarization techniques. API caveats are represented by sentences, which are context-independent, prominent, semantically diverse and non-redundant. The system provides a web-based interface that allows users to interactively explore the full picture of all discovered caveats of an API, and the details of each. The potential users of API Caveat Explorer are programmers and educators for learning and teaching APIs.

AB Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major death cause for children, requiring an early administration of appropriate antibiotics to cure it. To achieve this, accurate detection of pathogenic microorganism is crucial, especially for reducing the abuse of antibiotics. Conventional gold standard detection methods are mainly etiology based, incurring high cost and labor intensity. Although recently electronic health records (EHRs) become prevalent and widely used, their power for automatically determining pathogenic microorganism has not been investigated. In this paper, we formulate a new problem for automatically detecting pathogenic microorganism of CAP by considering patient biomedical features from EHRs, including time-varying body temperatures and common laboratory measurements. We further develop a Patient Attention based Recurrent Neural Network (PA-RNN) model to fuse different patient features for detection. We conduct experiments on a real dataset, demonstrating utilizing electronic health records yields promising performance and PA-RNN outperforms several alternatives.

AB Real-time summarization systems that monitor document streams to identify relevant content have a few options for delivering system updates to users. In a mobile context, systems could send push notifications to users' mobile devices, hoping to grab their attention immediately. Alternatively, systems could silently deposit updates into "inboxes" that users can access at their leisure. We refer to these mechanisms as push-based vs. pull-based, and present a two-year contrastive study that attempts to understand the effects of the delivery mechanism on mobile user behavior, in the context of the TREC Real-Time Summarization Tracks. Through a cluster analysis, we are able to identify three distinct and coherent patterns of behavior. As expected, we find that users are likely to ignore push notifications, but for those updates that users do pay attention to, content is consumed within a short amount of time. Interestingly, users bombarded with push notifications are less likely to consume updates on their own initiative and less likely to engage in long reading sessions-which is a common pattern for users who pull content from their inboxes. We characterize users as exhibiting "eager" or "apathetic" information consumption behavior as an explanation of these observations, and attempt to operationalize our findings into design recommendations.

   Sequential Recommendation
AB Recurrent Neural Networks have been successful in learning meaningful representations from sequence data, such as text and speech. However, recurrent neural networks attempt to model only the overall structure of each sequence independently, which is unsuitable for recommendations. In recommendation system, an optimal model should not only capture the global structure, but also the localized relationships. This poses a great challenge in the application of recurrent neural networks to the sequence prediction problem. To tackle this challenge, we incorporate the neighbor sequences into recurrent neural networks to help detect local relationships. Thus we propose a K-plet Recurrent Neural Network (Kr Network for short) to accommodate multiple sequences jointly, and then introduce two ways to model their interactions between sequences. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our proposed architecture Kr Network outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of generalization, short-term and long term prediction accuracy.

DE Unsupervised cross-lingual IR; cross-lingual vector spaces
AB We propose a fully unsupervised framework for ad-hoc cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) which requires no bilingual data at all. The framework leverages shared cross-lingual word embedding spaces in which terms, queries, and documents can be represented, irrespective of their actual language. The shared embedding spaces are induced solely on the basis of monolingual corpora in two languages through an iterative process based on adversarial neural networks. Our experiments on the standard CLEF CUR collections for three language pairs of varying degrees of language similarity (English-Dutch/Italian/Finnish) demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed fully unsupervised approach. Our CUR models with unsupervised cross-lingual embeddings outperform baselines that utilize cross-lingual embeddings induced relying on word-level and document-level alignments. We then demonstrate that further improvements can be achieved by unsupervised ensemble CUR models. We believe that the proposed framework is the first step towards development of effective CUR models for language pairs and domains where parallel data are scarce or non-existent.

DE Session Search; User Satisfaction; Search Evaluation
ID GAIN-BASED EVALUATION
AB User satisfaction has been paid much attention to in recent Web search evaluation studies and regarded as the ground truth for designing better evaluation metrics. However, most existing studies are focused on the relationship between satisfaction and evaluation metrics at query-level. However, while search request becomes more and more complex, there are many scenarios in which multiple queries and multi-round search interactions are needed (e.g. exploratory search). In those cases, the relationship between session-level search satisfaction and session search evaluation metrics remain uninvestigated. In this paper, we analyze how users' perceptions of satisfaction accord with a series of session-level evaluation metrics. We conduct a laboratory study in which users are required to finish some complex search tasks and provide usefulness judgments of documents as well as session-level and query level satisfaction feedbacks. We test a number of popular session search evaluation metrics as well as different weighting functions. Experiment results show that query-level satisfaction is mainly decided by the clicked document that they think the most useful (maximum effect). While session-level satisfaction is highly correlated with the most recently issued queries (recency effect). We further propose a number of criteria for designing better session search evaluation metrics.

   Multi-modal Asset-aware Projection
AB Following the rising prominence of online social networks, we observe an emerging trend for brands to adopt influencer marketing, embracing key opinion leaders (KOLs) to reach potential customers (PCs) online. Owing to the growing strategic importance of these brand key assets, this paper presents a novel feature extraction method named Multi-modal Assetaware Projection (M(2)A(2)P) to learn a discriminative subspace from the high-dimensional multi-modal social media data for effective brand key asset discovery. By formulating a new asset-aware discriminative information preserving criterion, M(2)A(2)P differentiates with the existing multi-model feature extraction algorithms in two pivotal aspects: 1) We consider brand's highly imbalanced class interest steering towards the KOLs and PCs over the irrelevant users; 2) We consider a common observation that a user is not exclusive to a single class (e.g. a KOL can also be a PC). Experiments on a real-world apparel brand key asset dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

DE Multivariate time series; Forecasting
AB In this work, we focus on models and analysis of multivariate time series data that are organized in hierarchies. Such time series are referred to as hierarchical time series (HTS) and they are very common in business, management, energy consumption, social networks, or web traffic modeling and analysis. We propose a new flexible hierarchical forecasting framework, that takes advantage of the hierarchical relational structure to predict individual time series. Our new forecasting framework is able to (1) handle HTS modeling and forecasting problems; (2) make accurate forecasting for HTS with seasonal patterns; (3) incorporate various individual forecasting models and combine heuristics based on the HTS datasets' own characterization. The proposed framework is evaluated on a real-world web traffic data set. The results demonstrate that our approach is superior when applied to hierarchical web traffic prediction problems, and it outperforms alternative time series prediction models in terms of accuracy.

AB The recent advances in deep neural networks have demonstrated high capability in a wide variety of scenarios. Nevertheless, fine-tuning deep models in a new domain still requires a significant amount of labeled data despite expensive labeling efforts. A valid question is how to leverage the source knowledge plus unlabeled or only sparsely labeled target data for learning a new model in target domain. The core problem is to bring the source and target distributions closer in the feature space. In the paper, we facilitate this issue in an adversarial learning framework, in which a domain discriminator is devised to handle domain shift. Particularly, we explore the learning in the context of hashing problem, which has been studied extensively due to its great efficiency in gigantic data. Specifically, a novel Deep Domain Adaptation Hashing with Adversarial learning (DeDAHA) architecture is presented, which mainly consists of three components: a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for learning basic image/frame representation followed by an adversary stream on one hand to optimize the domain discriminator, and on the other, to interact with each domain-specific hashing stream for encoding image representation to hash codes. The whole architecture is trained end-to-end by jointly optimizing two types of losses, i.e., triplet ranking loss to preserve the relative similarity ordering in the input triplets and adversarial loss to maximally fool the domain discriminator with the learnt source and target feature distributions. Extensive experiments are conducted on three domain transfer tasks, including cross-domain digits retrieval, image to image and image to video transfers, on several benchmarks. Our DeDAHA framework achieves superior results when compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.

AB Understanding user interests and expertise is a vital component toward creating rich user models for information personalization in social media, recommender systems and web search. To capture the pair-wise interactions between geo-location and user's topical profile in social-spatial systems, we propose the modeling of fine-grained and multi-dimensional user geo-topic profiles. We then propose a two-layered Bayesian hierarchical user factorization generative framework to overcome user heterogeneity and another enhanced model integrated with user's contextual information to alleviate multi-dimensional sparsity. Through extensive experiments, we find the proposed model leads to a 5 similar to 13% improvement in precision and recall over the alternative baselines and an additional 6-11% improvement with the integration of user's contexts.

   preference; Click-through rate; User satisfaction
AB Click signal has been widely used for designing and evaluating interactive information systems, which is taken as the indicator of user preference. However, click signal does not capture post-click user experience. Very commonly, the user first clicked an item and then found it is not what he wanted after reading its content, which shows there is a gap between user click and user actual preference. Previous studies on web search have incorporated other user behaviors, such as dwell time, to reduce the gap. Unfortunately, for other scenarios such as recommendation and online news reading, there still lacks a thorough understanding of the relationship between click and user preference, and the corresponding reasons which are the focus of this work. Based on an in-depth laboratory user study of online news reading scenario in the mobile environment, we show that click signal does not align with user preference. Besides, we find that user preference changes frequently, hence preferences in three phases are proposed: Before-Read Preference, After-Read Preference and Post-task Preference. In addition, the statistic analysis shows that the changes are highly related to news quality and the context of user interactions. Meanwhile, many other user behaviors, like viewport time, dwell time, and read speed, are found reflecting user preference in different phases. Furthermore, with the help of various kinds of user behaviors, news quality, and interaction context, we build an effective model to predict whether the user actually likes the clicked news. Finally, we replace binary click signals of traditional click-based evaluation metrics, like Click-Through Rate, with the predicted item-level preference, and significant improvements are achieved in estimating the user's list-level satisfaction. Our work sheds light on the understanding of user click behaviors and provides a method for better estimating user interest and satisfaction. The proposed model could also be helpful to various recommendation tasks in mobile scenarios.

DE post-click conversion rate; multi-task learning; sample selection bias;
   data sparsity; entire-space modeling
AB Estimating post-click conversion rate (CVR) accurately is crucial for ranking systems in industrial applications such as recommendation and advertising. Conventional CVR modeling applies popular deep learning methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. However it encounters several task-specific problems in practice, making CVR modeling challenging. For example, conventional CVR models are trained with samples of clicked impressions while utilized to make inference on the entire space with samples of all impressions. This causes a sample selection bias problem. Besides, there exists an extreme data .sparsity problem, making the model fitting rather difficult. In this paper, we model CVR in a brand-new perspective by making good use of sequential pattern of user actions, i.e., impression -> click -> conversion. The proposed Entire Space Multi-task Model (ESMM) can eliminate the two problems simultaneously by i) modeling CVR directly over the entire space, ii) employing a feature representation transfer learning strategy. Experiments on dataset gathered from traffic logs of Taobao's recommender system demonstrate that ESMM significantly outperforms competitive methods. We also release a sampling version of this dataset to enable future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first public dataset which contains samples with sequential dependence of click and conversion labels for CVR modeling.

AB Experimentation using information retrieval (IR) systems has traditionally been a procedural and laborious process. Queries must be run on an index, with any parameters of the retrieval models suitably tuned. With the advent of learning-to-rank, such experimental processes (including the appropriate folding of queries to achieve cross-fold validation) have resulted in complicated experimental designs and hence scripting. At the same time, machine learning platforms such as Scikit Learn and Apache Spark have pioneered the notion of an experimental pipeline, which naturally allows a supervised classification experiment to be expressed as a series of stages, which can be learned or transformed. In this demonstration, we detail Terrier-Spark, a recent adaptation to the Terrier IR platform which permits it to be used within the experimental pipelines of Spark. We argue that this (1) provides an agile experimental platform for information retrieval, comparable to that enjoyed by other branches of data science; (2) aids research reproducibility in information retrieval by facilitating easily-distributable notebooks containing conducted experiments; and (3) facilitates the teaching of information retrieval experiments in educational environments.

DE Click Model; Mobile Search; Web Search
AB Users' click-through behavior is considered as a valuable yet noisy source of implicit relevance feedback for web search engines. A series of click models have therefore been proposed to extract accurate and unbiased relevance feedback from click logs. Previous works have shown that users' search behaviors in mobile and desktop scenarios are rather different in many aspects, therefore, the click models that were designed for desktop search may not be as effective in mobile context. To address this problem, we propose a novel Mobile Click Model (MCM) that models how users examine and click search results on mobile SERPs. Specifically, we incorporate two biases that are prevalent in mobile search into existing click models: 1) the click necessity bias that some results can bring utility and usefulness to users without being clicked; 2) the examination satisfaction bias that a user may feel satisfied and stop searching after examining a result with low click necessity. Extensive experiments on large-scale real mobile search logs show that: 1) MCM outperforms existing models in predicting users' click behavior in mobile search; 2) MCM can extract richer information, such as the click necessity of search results and the probability of user satisfaction, from mobile click logs. With this information, we can estimate the quality of different vertical results and improve the ranking of heterogeneous results in mobile search.

AB Domain adaptation refers to the learning scenario where a model learned from the source data is applied on the target data which have the same categories but different distributions. In information retrieval, there exist application scenarios like cross domain recommendation characterized similarly. In this paper, by utilizing deep features extracted from the deep networks, we proposed to compute the multi-layer joint kernelized mean distance between the kth target data predicted as the ith category and all the source data of the jth category d(ij)(k). Then, target data T-m that are most likely to belong to the ith category can be found by calculating the relative distance d(ii)(k)/Sigma(j)d(ij)(k). By iteratively adding T-m to the training data, the fine-tuned deep model can adapt on the target data progressively. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a better performance compared to a number of state-of-the-art methods.

The proposed research leverages the recent advancements in information extraction and relational learning to revisit and advance the core ideas of concept-centered hypertext models. The automatic extraction of semantic relations from documents - and their centrality in the creation and exploitation of the documents' semantic networks - represents our attempt to go one step further than previous approaches.

DE A/B testing; Online Experiments; Open Source Platform
AB In order to improve long-term retention, ad conversion rates, and so on, A/B testing has become the norm within Web portals, enabling efficient large-scale experimentation. While A/B testing is also increasingly used by academic researchers (with crowd-working platforms offering a large pool of artificial users), few platforms are freely available to this end. Academic researchers usually develop adhoc solutions, leading to many duplicated efforts and time spent on work not directly related to one's research. As an alternative, we have developed and open sourced APONE, an Academic Platform for ONline Experiments. APONE uses PlanOut, a framework and high-level language, to specify online experiments, and offers Web services and a Web GUI to easily create, manage and monitor them. By building a user friendly Web application, we enable not only experts to conduct valid A/B experiments. In particular as a secondary use case, we envision large classrooms to also benefit from the deployment of APONE, a vision we put into practice in a graduate Information Retrieval course. We open-source APONE at https://marrerom.github.io/APONE. A demo version is running at http://ireplatform.ewi.tudelft.nl:8080/APONE.

AB The development of automatic systems that can produce timeline summaries by filtering high-volume streams of text documents, retaining only those that are relevant to a particular information need (e.g. topic or event), remains a very challenging task. To advance the field of automatic timeline generation, robust and reproducible evaluation methodologies are needed. To this end, several evaluation metrics and labeling methodologies have recently been developed - focusing on information nugget or cluster-based ground truth representations, respectively. These methodologies rely on human assessors manually mapping timeline items (e.g. tweets) to an explicit representation of what information a 'good' summary should contain. However, while these evaluation methodologies produce reusable ground truth labels, prior works have reported cases where such labels fail to accurately estimate the performance of new timeline generation systems due to label incompleteness. In this paper, we first quantify the extent to which timeline summary ground truth labels fail to generalize to new summarization systems, then we propose and evaluate new automatic solutions to this issue. In particular, using a depooling methodology over 21 systems and across three high-volume datasets, we quantify the degree of system ranking error caused by excluding those systems when labeling. We show that when considering lower-effectiveness systems, the test collections are robust (the likelihood of systems being miss-ranked is low). However, we show that the risk of systems being miss-ranked increases as the effectiveness of systems held-out from the pool increases. To reduce the risk of miss-ranking systems, we also propose two different automatic ground truth label expansion techniques. Our results show that our proposed expansion techniques can be effective for increasing the robustness of the TREC-TS test collections, markedly reducing the number of miss-rankings by up to 50% on average among the scenarios tested.

DE Knowledge Base Embedding; Link Prediction; Evaluation Metric
AB Building knowledge base embedding models for link prediction has achieved great success. We however argue that the conventional top-k criterion used for evaluating the model performance is inappropriate. This paper introduces a new criterion, referred to as max-k. Through theoretical analysis and experimental study, we show that the top-k criterion is fundamentally inferior to max-k. We also introduce two prediction protocols for the max-k criterion. These protocols are strongly justified theoretically. Various insights concerning the max-k criterion and the two protocols are obtained through extensive experiments.

AB Current plagiarism detection systems reliably find instances of copied and moderately altered text, but often fail to detect strong paraphrases, translations, and the reuse of non-textual content and ideas. To improve upon the detection capabilities for such concealed content reuse in academic publications, we make four contributions: i) We present the first plagiarism detection approach that combines the analysis of mathematical expressions, images, citations and text. ii) We describe the implementation of this hybrid detection approach in the research prototype HyPlag. iii) We present novel visualization and interaction concepts to aid users in reviewing content similarities identified by the hybrid detection approach. iv) We demonstrate the usefulness of the hybrid detection and result visualization approaches by using HyPlag to analyze a confirmed case of content reuse present in a retracted research publication.

AB One of the emerging and important problems in Interactive Information Retrieval research is predicting search tasks. Given a searcher's behavior during a search session, can the searcher's task be predicted? Which aspects of the task can be predicted, and how quickly and how accurately can the prediction be made? Much past literature has examined relationships between browsing behavior and task type at a statistical level, and recent work is moving towards prediction. While one may think whole session measures are useful for prediction, recent findings on common measures have suggested the contrary. Can less of the session still be useful? We examine the opposite end: the first query. Using multiple data sets for comparison, our results suggest that first query measures can be at least as good as - and sometimes better than - whole session measures for certain task type predictions.

AB Axiomatic analysis is a well-defined theoretical framework for analytical evaluation of information retrieval models. The current studies in axiomatic analysis implicitly assume that the constraints (axioms) are independent. In this paper, we revisit this assumption and hypothesize that there might be interdependence relationships between the existing constraints. As a preliminary study, we focus on the pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) models that have been theoretically studied using the axiomatic analysis approach. In this paper, we introduce two novel interdependent PRF constraints which emphasize on the effect of existing constraints on each other. We further modify two state-of-the-art PRF models, log-logistic and relevance models, in order to satisfy the proposed constraints. Experiments on three TREC newswire and web collections demonstrate that the proposed modifications significantly outperform the baselines, in all cases.

AB Every day more technologies and services are backed by complex machine-learned models, consuming large amounts of data to provide a myriad of useful services. While users are willing to provide personal data to enable these services, their trust in and engagement with the systems could be improved by providing insight into how the machine learned decisions were made. Complex ML systems are highly effective but many of them are black boxes and give no insight into how they make the choices they make. Moreover, those that do often do so at the model-level rather than the instance-level.
   In this work we present a method for deriving explanations for instance-level decisions in tree ensembles. As this family of models accounts for a large portion of industrial machine learning, this work opens up the possibility for transparent models at scale.

AB A large body of research work and efforts have been focused on detecting fake news and building online fact-check systems in order to debunk fake news as soon as possible. Despite the existence of these systems, fake news is still wildly shared by online users. It indicates that these systems may not be fully utilized. After detecting fake news, what is the next step to stop people from sharing it? How can we improve the utilization of these fact-check systems? To fill this gap, in this paper, we (i) collect and analyze online users called guardians, who correct misinformation and fake news in online discussions by referring fact-checking URLs; and (ii) propose a novel fact-checking URL recommendation model to encourage the guardians to engage more in fact-checking activities. We found that the guardians usually took less than one day to reply to claims in online conversations and took another day to spread verified information to hundreds of millions of followers. Our proposed recommendation model outperformed four state-of-the-art models by 11%similar to 33%. Our source code and dataset are available at http://web.cs.wpi.eduk-kmlee/data/gau.html.

AB The concept of surprise is central to human learning and development. However, compared to accuracy, surprise has received little attention in the IR community, yet it is an essential component of the information seeking process. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners of IR to discuss the topic of computational surprise, to set a research agenda, and to examine how to build datasets for research into this fascinating topic. The themes in this workshop include discussion of what can be learned from some well-known surprise models in other fields, such as Bayesian surprise; how to evaluate surprise based on user experience; and how computational surprise is related to the newly emerging areas, such as fake news detection, computational contradiction, clickbait detection, etc.

ID DIMENSIONS; HOSTILE; SEXISM
AB There is growing evidence that search engines produce results that are socially biased, reinforcing a view of the world that aligns with prevalent social stereotypes. One means to promote greater transparency of search algorithms - which are typically complex and proprietary - is to raise user awareness of biased result sets. However, to date, little is known concerning how users perceive bias in search results, and the degree to which their perceptions differ and/or might be predicted based on user attributes. One particular area of search that has recently gained attention, and forms the focus of this study, is image retrieval and gender bias. We conduct a controlled experiment via crowdsourcing using participants recruited from three countries to measure the extent to which workers perceive a given image results set to be subjective or objective. Demographic information about the workers, along with measures of sexism, are gathered and analysed to investigate whether (gender) biases in the image search results can be detected. Amongst other findings, the results confirm that sexist people are less likely to detect and report gender biases in image search results.

AB We present CoNEREL, a system for collective named entity recognition and entity linking focusing on news articles and readers' comments. Different from other systems, CoNEREL processes articles and comments in batch mode, to make the best use of the shared contexts of multiple news stories and their comments. Particularly, a news article provides context for all its comments. To improve named entity recognition, CoNEREL utilizes co-reference of mentions to refine their class labels (e.g., person, location). To link the recognized entities to Wikipedia, our system implements Pair-Linking, a state-of-the-art entity linking algorithm. Furthermore, CoNEREL provides an interactive visualization of the Pair-Linking process. From the visualization, one can understand how Pair-Linking achieves decent linking performance through iterative evidence building, while being extremely fast and efficient. The graph formed by the Pair-Linking process naturally becomes a good summary of entity relations, making CoNEREL a useful tool to study the relationships between the entities mentioned in an article, as well as the ones that are discussed in its comments.

AB Sections are the building blocks of Wikipedia articles. They enhance readability and can be used as a structured entry point for creating and expanding articles. Structuring a new or already existing Wikipedia article with sections is a hard task for humans, especially for newcomers or less experienced editors, as it requires significant knowledge about how a well-written article looks for each possible topic. Inspired by this need, the present paper defines the problem of section recommendation for Wikipedia articles and proposes several approaches for tackling it. Our systems can help editors by recommending what sections to add to already existing or newly created Wikipedia articles. Our basic paradigm is to generate recommendations by sourcing sections from articles that are similar to the input article. We explore several ways of defining similarity for this purpose (based on topic modeling, collaborative filtering, and Wikipedia's category system). We use both automatic and human evaluation approaches for assessing the performance of our recommendation system, concluding that the category-based approach works best, achieving precision@10 of about 80% in the human evaluation.

AB This paper studies the consistency of the kernel-based neural ranking model (K-NRM), a recent state-of-the-art neural IR model, which is important for reproducible research and deployment in the industry. We find that K-NRM has low variance on relevance-based metrics across experimental trials. In spite of this low variance in overall performance, different trials produce different document rankings for individual queries. The main source of variance in our experiments was found to be different latent matching patterns captured by K-NRM. In the IR-customized word embeddings learned by K-NRM, the query-document word pairs follow two different matching patterns that are equally effective, but align word pairs differently in the embedding space. The different latent matching patterns enable a simple yet effective approach to construct ensemble rankers, which improve K-NRM's effectiveness and generalization abilities.

DE Information-seeking; Conversational Search; User Intent
AB Understanding and characterizing how people interact in information-seeking conversations is crucial in developing conversational search systems. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset designed for this purpose and use it to analyze information-seeking conversations by user intent distribution, co-occurrence, and flow patterns. The MSDialog dataset is a labeled dialog dataset of question answering (QA) interactions between information seekers and providers from an online forum on Microsoft products. The dataset contains more than 2,000 multi-turn QA dialogs with 10,000 utterances that are annotated with user intent on the utterance level. Annotations were done using crowdsourcing. With MSDialog, we find some highly recurring patterns in user intent during an information-seeking process. They could be useful for designing conversational search systems. We will make our dataset freely available to encourage exploration of information-seeking conversation models.

AB A recently-introduced product of Comcast, a large cable company in the United States, is a "voice remote" that accepts spoken queries from viewers. We present an analysis of a large query log from this service to answer the question: "What do viewers say to their TVs?" In addition to a descriptive characterization of queries and sessions, we describe two complementary types of analyses to support query understanding. First, we propose a domain-specific intent taxonomy to characterize viewer behavior: as expected, most intents revolve around watching programs-both direct navigation as well as browsing-but there is a non-trivial fraction of non-viewing intents as well. Second, we propose a domain-specific tagging scheme for labeling query tokens, that when combined with intent and program prediction, provides a multi-faceted approach to understand voice queries directed at entertainment systems.

I will then talk about two specific applications where we use a variety of methods to learn semantically rich representations of data: question answering where we use deep learning techniques and product size recommendations where we use probabilistic models, and fake reviews detection where we use tensor factorization algorithms.

AB We present and formalize the due diligence problem, where lawyers extract data from legal documents to assess risk in a potential merger or acquisition, as an information retrieval task. Furthermore, we describe the creation and annotation of a document collection for the due diligence problem that will foster research in this area. This dataset comprises 50 topics over 4,412 documents and similar to 15 million sentences and is a subset of our own internal training data.
   Using this dataset, we present what we have found to be the state of the art for information extraction in the due diligence problem. In particular, we find that when treating documents as sequences of labelled and unlabelled sentences, Conditional Random Fields significantly and substantially outperform other techniques for sequence-based (Hidden Markov Models) and non-sequence based machine learning (logistic regression). Included in this is an analysis of what we perceive to be the major failure cases when extraction is performed based upon sentence labels.

AB A user with a standing need for updates on current events uses a structured exploration process for finding and reviewing new documents, with the user comparing document information to her mental model. To avoid missing key changes on the topic, the user should see some documents on each of the subtopics available that day. This research includes a system and evaluation approach for this standing need use case.

AB We propose IRevalOO, a flexible Object Oriented framework that (i) can be used as-is as a replacement of the widely adopted trec_eval software, and (ii) can be easily extended (or "instantiated", in framework terminology) to implement different scenarios of test collection based retrieval evaluation. Instances of IRevalOO can provide a usable and convenient alternative to the state-of-the-art software commonly used by different initiatives (TREC, NTCIR, CLEF, FIRE, etc.). Also, those instances can be easily adapted to satisfy future customization needs of researchers, as: implementing and experimenting with new metrics, even based on new notions of relevance; using different formats for system output and "qrels"; and in general visualizing, comparing, and managing retrieval evaluation results.

ID RETRIEVAL-SYSTEMS
AB Several researchers have proposed to reduce the number of topics used in TREC-like initiatives. One research direction that has been pursued is what is the optimal topic subset of a given cardinality that evaluates the systems/runs in the most accurate way. Such a research direction has been so far mainly theoretical, with almost no indication on how to select the few good topics in practice. We propose such a practical criterion for topic selection: we rely on the methods for automatic system evaluation without relevance judgments, and by running some experiments on several TREC collections we show that the topics selected on the basis of those evaluations are indeed more informative than random topics.

AB In test collection based evaluation of retrieval effectiveness, many research investigated different directions for an economical and a semi-automatic evaluation of retrieval systems. Although several methods have been proposed and experimentally evaluated, their accuracy seems still limited. In this paper we present our proposal for a more engineered approach to information retrieval evaluation.

AB We focus on the post-retrieval query performance prediction (QPP) task. Specifically, we make a new use of passage information for this task. Using such information we derive a new mean score calibration predictor that provides a more accurate prediction. Using an empirical evaluation over several common TREC benchmarks, we show that, QPP methods that only make use of document-level features are mostly suited for short query prediction tasks; while such methods perform significantly worse in verbose query prediction settings. We further demonstrate that, QPP methods that utilize passage-information are much better suited for verbose settings. Moreover, our proposed predictor, which utilizes both document-level and passage-level features provides a more accurate and consistent prediction for both types of queries. Finally, we show a connection between our predictor and a recently proposed supervised QPP method, which results in an enhanced prediction.

AB In web search, typically a candidate generation step selects a small set of documents-from collections containing as many as billions of web pages-that are subsequently ranked and pruned before being presented to the user. In Bing, the candidate generation involves scanning the index using statically designed match plans that prescribe sequences of different match criteria and stopping conditions. In this work, we pose match planning as a reinforcement learning task and observe up to 20% reduction in index blocks accessed, with small or no degradation in the quality of the candidate sets.

ID SOCIAL MEDIA
AB In recent times, humanitarian organizations increasingly rely on social media to search for information useful for disaster response. These organizations have varying information needs ranging from general situational awareness (i.e., to understand a bigger picture) to focused information needs e.g., about infrastructure damage, urgent needs of affected people. This research proposes a novel approach to help crisis responders fulfill their information needs at different levels of granularities. Specifically, the proposed approach presents simple algorithms to identify sub-events and generate summaries of big volume of messages around those events using an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) technique. Extensive evaluation on a large set of real world Twitter dataset shows (a). our algorithm can identify important sub-events with high recall (b). the summarization scheme shows (6-30%) higher accuracy of our system compared to many other state-of-the-art techniques. The simplicity of the algorithms ensures that the entire task is done in real time which is needed for practical deployment of the system.

ID HEALTH INFORMATION
AB Medical information retrieval suffers from a dual problem: users struggle in describing what they are experiencing from a medical perspective and the search engine is struggling in retrieving the information exactly matching what users are experiencing. We demonstrate interactive symptom elicitation for diagnostic information retrieval. Interactive symptom elicitation builds a model from the user's initial description of the symptoms and interactively elicitates new information about symptoms by posing questions of related, but uncertain, symptoms for the user. As a result, the system interactively learns the estimates of symptoms while controlling the uncertainties related to the diagnostic process. The learned model is then used to rank the associated diagnoses that the user might be experiencing. Our preliminary experimental results show that interactive symptom elicitation can significantly improve user's capability to describe their symptoms, increase the confidence of the model, and enable effective diagnostic information retrieval.

ID DISTANCE
AB Some modern information access tasks such as natural language dialogue tasks are difficult to evaluate, for often there is no such thing as the ground truth: different users may have different opinions about the system's output. A few task designs for dialogue evaluation have been implemented and/or proposed recently, where both the ground truth data and the system's output are represented as a distribution of users' votes over bins on a non-nominal scale. The present study first points out that popular bin-by-bin measures such as Jensen-Shannon divergence and Sum of Squared Errors are clearly not adequate for such tasks, and that cross-bin measures should be used. Through experiments using artificial distributions as well as real ones from a dialogue evaluation task, we demonstrate that two cross-bin measures, namely, the Normalised Match Distance (NMD; a special case of the Earth Mover's Distance) and the Root Symmetric Normalised Order-aware Divergence (RSNOD), are indeed substantially different from the bin-by-bin measures. Furthermore, RSNOD lies between the popular bin-by-bin measures and NMD in terms of how it behaves. We recommend using both of these measures in the aforementioned type of evaluation tasks.

AB Errors in formulation of queries made by users can lead to poor search results pages. We performed a living lab study using online A/B testing to measure the degree of improvement achieved with a query amendment technique when applied to a commercial job search engine. Of particular interest in this case study is a clear "success" signal, namely, the number of job applications lodged by a user as a result of querying the service. A set of 276 queries was identified for amendment in four different categories through the use of word embeddings, with large gains in conversion rates being attained in all four of those categories. Our analysis of query reformulations also provides a better understanding of user satisfaction in the case of problematic queries (ones with fewer results than fill a single page) by observing that users tend to reformulate rewritten queries less.

AB A new educational service has been prototyped by Echo360 that uses natural language processing to analyze students notes and provide personalized recommendations on how to both improve note-taking and scaffold learning. The LessonWare middleware system uses computer-generated transcriptions from class captures and available student notes to identify key terms mentioned during class sessions. The combination of analyzed key terms and corresponding timestamps allows contextual linkages to be created between educational resources. Student notes are automatically augmented with corresponding moments in class captures, specific pages in the course eTextbook or open education resources or specific adaptive learning assets.

The development of a coreferent mention retrieval test collection is then described. Results are presented for five coreferent mention retrieval systems, both to illustrate the use of the collection and to specify the results that were pooled on which human coreference judgments were performed. The new test collection is built from content that is available from the Linguistic Data Consortium; the partitioning and human annotations used to create the test collection atop that content are being made freely available.

AB Systematic reviews form the cornerstone of evidence based medicine, aiming to answer complex medical questions based on all evidence currently available. Key to the effectiveness of a systematic review is an (often large) Boolean query used to search large publication repositories. These Boolean queries are carefully crafted by researchers and information specialists, and often reviewed by a panel of experts. However, little is known about the effectiveness of the Boolean queries at the time of formulation.
   In this paper we investigate whether a better Boolean query than that defined in the protocol of a systematic review, can be created, and we develop methods for the transformation of a given Boolean query into a more effective one. Our approach involves defining possible transformations of Boolean queries and their clauses. It also involves casting the problem of identifying a transformed query that is better than the original into: (i) a classification problem; and (ii) a learning to rank problem. Empirical experiments are conducted on a real set of systematic reviews. Analysis of results shows that query transformations that are better than the original queries do exist, and that our approaches are able to select more effective queries from the set of possible transformed queries so as to maximise different target effectiveness measures.

AB When conducting systematic reviews, medical researchers heavily deliberate over the final query to pose to the information retrieval system. Given the possible query variations that they could construct, selecting the best performing query is difficult. This motivates a new type of query performance prediction (QPP) task where the challenge is to estimate the performance of a set of query variations given a particular topic. Query variations are the reductions, expansions and modifications of a given seed query under the hypothesis that there exists some variations (either generated from permutations or hand crafted) which will improve retrieval effectiveness over the original query. We use the CLEF 2017 TAR Collection, to evaluate sixteen pre and post retrieval predictors for the task of Query Variation Performance Prediction (QVPP). Our findings show the IDF based QPPs exhibits the strongest correlations with performance. However, when using QPPs to select the best query, little improvement over the original query can be obtained, despite the fact that there are query variations which perform significantly better. Our findings highlight the difficulty in identifying effective queries within the context of this new task, and motivates further research to develop more accurate methods to help systematic review researchers in the query selection process.

AB We present a framework for constructing and executing information retrieval experiment pipelines. The framework as a whole is built primarily for domain specific applications such as medical literature search for systematic reviews, or finding factually or legally applicable case law in the legal domain; however it can also be used for more general tasks. There are a number of pre-implemented components that enable common information retrieval experiments such as ad-hoc retrieval or query analysis through query performance predictors. In addition, this collection of tools seeks to be user friendly, well documented, and easily extendible. Finally, the entire pipeline can be distributed as a single binary with no dependencies, ready to use with a simple domain specific language (DSL) for constructing pipelines.

AB User-generated comments and tags can reveal important visual concepts associated with an image in Flickr. However, due to the inherent noisiness of the metadata, not all user tags are necessarily descriptive of the image. Likewise, comments may contain spam or chatter that are irrelevant to the image. Hence, identifying and ranking relevant tags and comments can boost applications such as tag-based image search, tag recommendation, etc. In this paper, we present a lightweight visual signature-based model to concurrently generate ranked lists of comments and tags of a social image based on their joint relevance to the visual features, user comments, and user tags. The proposed model is based on sparse reconstruction of the visual content of an image using its tags and comments. Through empirical study on Flickr dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed technique against state-of-the-art tag ranking and refinement techniques.

DE Evaluation Metric; Proactive Search; Contextual Recommendation
AB Traditional search system users actively interact with the system to complete their search task. We believe that the next generation of search systems will see a shift towards proactive understanding of user intent based on analysis of user activities. Such a proactive system could start recommending documents that are likely to help users accomplish their tasks without requiring them to explicitly submit queries to the system. We propose a framework to evaluate such a search system. The key idea behind our proposed metric is to aggregate a correlation measure over a search session between the expected outcome, which in this case refers to the list of documents retrieved with a true user query, and the predicted outcome, which refers to the list of documents recommended by a proactive search system. Experiments on the AOL query log data show that the ranking of two sample proactive IR systems induced by our metric conforms to the expected ranking between these systems.

AB Representation of news events as latent feature vectors is essential for several tasks, such as news recommendation, news event linking, etc. However, representations proposed in the past fail to capture the complex network structure of news events. In this paper we propose Event2Vec, a novel way to learn latent feature vectors for news events using a network. We use recently proposed network embedding techniques, which are proven to be very effective for various prediction tasks in networks. As events involve different classes of nodes, such as named entities, temporal information, etc, general purpose network embeddings are agnostic to event semantics. To address this problem, we propose biased random walks that are tailored to capture the neighborhoods of news events in event networks. We then show that these learned embeddings are effective for news event recommendation and news event linking tasks using strong baselines, such as vanilla Node2Vec, and other state-of-the-art graph-based event ranking techniques.

AB In real-time bidding advertising (RTB), the buyers bid for individual advertisement impressions provided by publishers in real time. The final goal of the buyers is to maximize the return on their investment. To gain higher returns, buyers prefer to first purchase more conversion impressions than click-only ones and then purchase more click-only impressions prior to non-click ones. Simultaneously, to reduce the expense, they need to accurately estimate a reasonable bid price, the predicted precision of which depends on the precision of the predicted conversion rate (CVR) or predicted click-through rate (CTR). Therefore, the predicted CVR or predicted CTR must provide not only good ranking values but also correct regression estimations. This paper is focused on the CVR estimation problem for buy-sides in RTB and a combined regression and tripletwise ranking method (CRT) is proposed that jointly considers regression loss and tripletwise ranking loss to estimate the CVR. This method attempts to rank conversion impressions above click-only ones and simultaneously rank click-only impressions above non-click ones. Meanwhile, through simultaneously utilizing the historical conversion and click information to alleviate sparsity, the CRT method is also aimed to achieve a good two category-ranking performance, as well as a good regression performance for predicting the CVR.

AB The cluster hypothesis is a fundamental concept in ad hoc retrieval. Heretofore, cluster hypothesis tests were applied to documents using binary relevance judgments. We present novel tests that utilize graded and focused relevance judgments; the latter are markups of relevant text in relevant documents. Empirical exploration reveals that the cluster hypothesis holds not only for documents, but also for passages, as measured by the proposed tests. Furthermore, the hypothesis holds to a higher extent for highly relevant documents and for those that contain a high fraction of relevant text.

AB Our main goal is studying the merits of using inter-passage similarities for the task of focused retrieval; i.e., ranking passages in documents by their relevance to an information need expressed by a query. As an initial research direction we study the cluster hypothesis for passage (focused) retrieval. We propose a novel suite of cluster hypothesis tests that employ inter-passage similarities and demonstrate that the cluster hypothesis holds for passages. In addition, we present several future directions we intend to pursue.

DE Entity-Set Aware Search; Unsupervised Ranking Model; Unsupervised Model
   Selection; Literature Search
AB Literature search is critical for any scientific research. Different from Web or general domain search, a large portion of queries in scientific literature search are entity-set queries, that is, multiple entities of possibly different types. Entity-set queries reflect user's need for finding documents that contain multiple entities and reveal inter-entity relationships and thus pose non-trivial challenges to existing search algorithms that model each entity separately. However, entity-set queries are usually sparse (i.e., not so repetitive), which makes ineffective many supervised ranking models that rely heavily on associated click history. To address these challenges, we introduce Set Rank, an unsupervised ranking framework that models inter-entity relationships and captures entity type information. Furthermore, we develop a novel unsupervised model selection algorithm, based on the technique of weighted rank aggregation, to automatically choose the parameter settings in Set Rank without resorting to a labeled validation set. We evaluate our proposed unsupervised approach using datasets from TREC Genomics Tracks and Semantic Scholar's query log. The experiments demonstrate that Set Rank significantly outperforms the baseline unsupervised models, especially on entity-set queries, and our model selection algorithm effectively chooses suitable parameter settings.

AB Question answering (QA) systems provide user-friendly interfaces for retrieving answers from structured and unstructured data given natural language questions. Several QA systems, as well as related components, have been contributed by the industry and research community in recent years. However, most of these efforts have been performed independently from each other and with different focuses, and their synergies in the scope of QA have not been addressed adequately. FRANKENSTEIN is a novel framework for developing QA systems over knowledge bases by integrating existing state-of-the-art QA components performing different tasks. It incorporates several reusable QA components, employs machine learning techniques to predict best performing components and QA pipelines for a given question, and generates static and dynamic executable QA pipelines. In this paper, we illustrate different functionalities of FRANKENSTEIN for performing independent QA component execution, QA component prediction, given an input question as well as the static and dynamic composition of different QA pipelines.

AB Understanding the search tasks and search behavior of users is necessary for optimizing search engine results. While much work has been done on understanding the users in Web search, little knowledge is available about the search tasks and behavior of users in the E-Commerce (E-Com) search applications. In this paper, we share the first empirical study of the queries and search behavior of users in E-Com search by analyzing search log from a major E-Com search engine. The analysis results show that E-Com queries can be categorized into five categories, each with distinctive search behaviors: (1) Shallow Exploration Queries are short vague queries that a user may use initially in exploring the product space. (2) Targeted Purchase Queries are queries used by users to purchase items that they are generally familiar with, thus without much decision making. (3) Major-Item Shopping Queries are used by users to shop for a major item which is often relatively expensive and thus requires some serious exploration, but typically in a limited scope of choices. (4) Minor-Item Shopping Queries are used by users to shop for minor items that are generally not very expensive, but still require some exploration of choices. (5) Hard-Choice Shopping Queries are used by users who want to deeply explore all the candidate products before finalizing the choice often appropriate when multiple products must be carefully compared with each other. These five categories form a taxonomy for E-Com queries and can shed light on how we may develop customized search technologies for each type of search queries to improve search engine utility.

AB The rapidly increasing ubiquity of computing puts a great demand on next-generation human-machine interfaces. Natural language interfaces, exemplified by virtual assistants like Apple Siri and Microsoft Cortana, are widely believed to be a promising direction. However, current natural language interfaces provide users with little help in case of incorrect interpretation of user commands. We hypothesize that the support of fine-grained user interaction can greatly improve the usability of natural language interfaces. In the specific setting of natural language interfaces to web APIs, we conduct a systematic study to verify our hypothesis. To facilitate this study, we propose a novel modular sequence-to-sequence model to create interactive natural language interfaces. By decomposing the complex prediction process of a typical sequence-to-sequence model into small, highly-specialized prediction units called modules, it becomes straightforward to explain the model prediction to the user, and solicit user feedback to correct possible prediction errors at a fine-grained level. We test our hypothesis by comparing an interactive natural language interface with its non-interactive version through both simulation and human subject experiments with real-world APIs. We show that with interactive natural language interfaces, users can achieve a higher success rate and a lower task completion time, which lead to greatly improved user satisfaction.

AB Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most popular techniques for building recommender systems. To alleviate the data sparsity issue in CF, social recommendation has emerged by leveraging social influence among users for better recommendation performance. In these systems, uses' preferences over time are determined by their temporal dynamic interests as well as the general static interests. In the meantime, the complex interplay between users' internal interests and the social influence from the social network drives the evolution of users' preferences over time. Nevertheless, traditional approaches either neglected the social network structure for temporal recommendation or assumed a static social influence strength for static social recommendation. Thus, the problem of how to leverage social influence to enhance temporal social recommendation performance remains pretty much open. To this end, in this paper, we present an attentive recurrent network based approach for temporal social recommendation. In the proposed approach, we model users' complex dynamic and general static preferences over time by fusing social influence among users with two attention networks. Specifically, in the dynamic preference modeling process, we design a dynamic social aware recurrent neural network to capture users' complex latent interests over time, where a temporal attention network is proposed to learn the temporal social influence over time. In the general static preference modeling process, we characterize each user's static interest by introducing a static social attention network to model the stationary social influence among users. The output of the dynamic preferences and the static preferences are combined together in a unified end-to-end framework for the temporal social recommendation task. Finally, experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly show the superiority of our proposed model compared to the baselines.

AB A personalized conversational sales agent could have much commercial potential. E-commerce companies such as Amazon, eBay, JD, Alibaba etc. are piloting such kind of agents with their users. However, the research on this topic is very limited and existing solutions are either based on single round adhoc search engine or traditional multi round dialog system. They usually only utilize user inputs in the current session, ignoring users' long term preferences. On the other hand, it is well known that sales conversion rate can be greatly improved based on recommender systems, which learn user preferences based on past purchasing behavior and optimize business oriented metrics such as conversion rate or expected revenue. In this work, we propose to integrate research in dialog systems and recommender systems into a novel and unified deep reinforcement learning framework to build a personalized conversational recommendation agent that optimizes a per session based utility function.
   In particular, we propose to represent a user conversation history as a semi-structured user query with facet-value pairs. This query is generated and updated by belief tracker that analyzes natural language utterances of user at each step. We propose a set of machine actions tailored for recommendation agents and train a deep policy network to decide which action (i.e. asking for the value of a facet or making a recommendation) the agent should take at each step. We train a personalized recommendation model that uses both the user's past ratings and user query collected in the current conversational session when making rating predictions and generating recommendations. Such a conversational system often tries to collect user preferences by asking questions. Once enough user preference is collected, it makes personalized recommendations to the user. We perform both simulation experiments and real online user studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

DE Information Retrieval; User modeling; Multidimensional Relevance
AB It has been shown that relevance judgment of documents is influenced by multiple factors beyond topicality. Some multidimensional user relevance models (MURM) proposed in literature have investigated the impact of different dimensions of relevance on user judgment. Our hypothesis is that a user might give more importance to certain relevance dimensions in a session which might change dynamically as the session progresses. This motivates the need to capture the weights of different relevance dimensions using feedback and build a model to rank documents for subsequent queries according to these weights. We propose a geometric model inspired by the mathematical framework of Quantum theory to capture the user's importance given to each dimension of relevance and test our hypothesis on data from a web search engine and TREC Session track.

AB Part of Information Retrieval evaluation research is limited by the fact that we do not know the distributions of system effectiveness over the populations of topics and, by extension, their true mean scores. The workaround usually consists in resampling topics from an existing collection and approximating the statistics of interest with the observations made between random subsamples, as if one represented the population and the other a random sample. However, this methodology is clearly limited by the availability of data, the impossibility to control the properties of these data, and the fact that we do not really measure what we intend to. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method based on vine copulas for stochastic simulation of evaluation results where the true system distributions are known upfront. In the basic use case, it takes the scores from an existing collection to build a semi-parametric model representing the set of systems and the population of topics, which can then be used to make realistic simulations of the scores by the same systems but on random new topics. Our ability to simulate this kind of data not only eliminates the current limitations, but also offers new opportunities for research. As an example, we show the benefits of this approach in two sample applications replicating typical experiments found in the literature. We provide a full R package to simulate new data following the proposed method, which can also be used to fully reproduce the results in this paper.

AB We introduce pytrec_eval, a Python interface to the trec_eval information retrieval evaluation toolkit. pytrec_eval exposes the reference implementations of trec_eval within Python as a native extension. We show that pytrec_eval is around one order of magnitude faster than invoking trec_eval as a sub process from within Python. Compared to a native Python implementation of NDCG, pytrec_eval is twice as fast for practically-sized rankings. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness in an application where pytrec_eval is combined with Pyndri and the OpenAI Gym where query expansion is learned using Q-learning.

AB The rising need to harvest domain specific knowledge in several applications is largely limited by the ability to dynamically grow structured knowledge representations, due to the increasing emergence of new concepts and their semantic relationships with existing ones. Such enrichment of existing hierarchical knowledge sources with new information to better model the "changing world" presents two-fold challenges: (1) Detection of previously unknown entities or concepts, and (2) Insertion of the new concepts into the knowledge structure, respecting the semantic integrity of the created relationships. To this end we propose a novel framework, ETF, to enrich large-scale, generic taxonomies with new concepts from resources such as news and research publications. Our approach learns a high-dimensional embedding for the existing concepts of the taxonomy, as well as for the new concepts. During the insertion of a new concept, this embedding is used to identify semantically similar neighborhoods within the existing taxonomy. The potential parent-child relationships linking the new concepts to the existing ones are then predicted using a set of semantic and graph features. Extensive evaluations of ETF on large, real-world taxonomies of Wikipedia and WordNet showcase more than 5% F1-score improvements compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We further demonstrate that ETF can accurately categorize newly emerging concepts and question-answer pairs across different domains.

ID INFORMATION-SEEKING BEHAVIOR; LAWYERS
AB Professional search is a problem area in which many facets of information retrieval are addressed, both system-related (e.g. distributed search) and user-related (e.g. complex information needs), and the interface between user and system (e.g. supporting exploratory search tasks). Professional search tasks have specific requirements, different from the requirements of generic web search. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers to work on the requirements and challenges of professional search from different angles. We will have an interactive workshop where researchers not only present their scientific results but also work together on the definition of future challenges and solutions with input from information professionals. The workshop will deliver a roadmap of research directions for the years to come.

DE Contextual music recommendation; music listening intent
AB While activity-aware music recommendation has been shown to improve the listener experience, we posit that modeling the listening intent can further improve recommendation quality. In this paper, we perform initial exploration of the dominant music listening intents associated with common activities, using music retrieved from popular online music services. We show that these intents can be approximated through audio features of the music itself, and potentially improve recommendation quality. Our initial results, based on 10 common activities and 5 popular listening intents associated with these activities, support our hypothesis, and open a promising direction towards intent-aware contextual music recommendation.

DE Knowledge graphs; Fact contextualization; Distant supervision
AB Knowledge graphs (KGs) model facts about the world; they consist of nodes (entities such as companies and people) that are connected by edges (relations such as founderOf ). Facts encoded in KGs are frequently used by search applications to augment result pages. When presenting a KG fact to the user, providing other facts that are pertinent to that main fact can enrich the user experience and support exploratory information needs. KG fact contextualization is the task of augmenting a given KG fact with additional and useful KG facts. The task is challenging because of the large size of KGs; discovering other relevant facts even in a small neighborhood of the given fact results in an enormous amount of candidates.
   We introduce a neural fact contextualization method (NFCM) to address the KG fact contextualization task. NFCM first generates a set of candidate facts in the neighborhood of a given fact and then ranks the candidate facts using a supervised learning to rank model. The ranking model combines features that we automatically learn from data and that represent the query-candidate facts with a set of hand-crafted features we devised or adjusted for this task. In order to obtain the annotations required to train the learning to rank model at scale, we generate training data automatically using distant supervision on a large entity-tagged text corpus. We show that ranking functions learned on this data are effective at contextualizing KG facts. Evaluation using human assessors shows that it significantly outperforms several competitive baselines.

AB Knowledge graph completion is a critical issue because many applications benefit from their structural and rich resources. In this paper, we propose a method named TransN, which considers the dependencies between triples and incorporates neighbor information dynamically. In experiments, we evaluate our model by link prediction and also conduct several qualitative analyses to prove effectiveness. Experimental results show that our model could integrate neighbor information effectively and outperform state-of-the-art models.

AB Data providers have a profound contribution to many fields such as finance, economy, and academia by serving people with both web-based and API-based query service of specialized data. Among the data users, there are data resellers who abuse the query APIs to retrieve and resell the data to make a profit, which harms the data provider's interests and causes copyright infringement. In this work, we define the "anti-data-reselling" problem and propose a new systematic method that combines feature engineering and machine learning models to provide a solution. We apply our method to a real query log of over 9,000 users with limited labels provided by a large financial data provider and get reasonable results, insightful observations, and real deployments.

DE Sentiment analysis; peer review mining; multiple instance learning;
   abstract-based memory mechanism
AB Sentiment analysis has been widely explored in many text domains, including product reviews, movie reviews, tweets, and so on. However, there are very few studies trying to perform sentiment analysis in the domain of peer reviews for scholarly papers, which are usually long and introducing both pros and cons of a paper submission. In this paper, we for the first time investigate the task of automatically predicting the overall recommendation/decision (accept, reject, or sometimes borderline) and further identifying the sentences with positive and negative sentiment polarities from a peer review text written by a reviewer for a paper submission. We propose a multiple instance learning network with a novel abstract-based memory mechanism (MILAM) to address this challenging task. Two evaluation datasets are constructed from the ICLR open reviews and evaluation results verified the efficacy of our proposed model. Our model much outperforms a few existing models in different experimental settings. We also find the generally good consistency between the review texts and the recommended decisions, except for the borderline reviews.

DE Pairwise Attention Model; Dynamic Threshold Predictor; Multi-label
   Classification
ID LABEL; PREDICTION
AB In juridical field, judges usually need to consult several relevant cases to determine the specific articles that the evidence violated, which is a task that is time consuming and needs extensive professional knowledge. In this paper, we focus on how to save the manual efforts and make the conviction process more efficient. Specifically, we treat the evidences as documents, and articles as labels, thus the conviction process can be cast as a multi-label classification problem. However, the challenge in this specific scenario lies in two aspects. One is that the number of articles that evidences violated is dynamic, which we denote as the label dynamic problem. The other is that most articles are violated by only a few of the evidences, which we denote as the label imbalance problem. Previous methods usually learn the multi-label classification model and the label thresholds independently, and may ignore the label imbalance problem. To tackle with both challenges, we propose a unified Dynamic Pairwise Attention Model (DPAM for short) in this paper. Specifically, DPAM adopts the multi-task learning paradigm to learn the multi-label classifier and the threshold predictor jointly, and thus DPAM can improve the generalization performance by leveraging the information learned in both of the two tasks. In addition, a pairwise attention model based on article definitions is incorporated into the classification model to help alleviate the label imbalance problem. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multi-label classification methods.

   applications; user behaviour modeling
AB Studying recommender systems under streaming scenarios has become increasingly important because real-world applications produce data continuously and rapidly. However, most existing recommender systems today are designed in the context of an offline setting. Compared with the traditional recommender systems, large-volume and high-velocity are posing severe challenges for streaming recommender systems. In this paper, we investigate the problem of streaming recommendations being subject to higher input rates than they can immediately process with their available system resources (i.e., CPU and memory). In particular, we provide a principled framework called as SPMF (Stream-centered Probabilistic Matrix Factorization model), based on BPR (Bayesian Personalized Ranking) optimization framework, for performing efficient ranking based recommendations in stream settings. Experiments on three real-world datasets illustrate the superiority of SPMF in online recommendations.

DE Multi-turn Dialog Systems; Response Generation; Deepening and Widening
   Topics; Multi-turn Dialog Dataset
AB The past decade has witnessed the boom of human-machine interactions, particularly via dialog systems. In this paper, we study the task of response generation in open-domain multi-turn dialog systems. Many research efforts have been dedicated to building intelligent dialog systems, yet few shed light on deepening or widening the chatting topics in a conversational session, which would attract users to talk more. To this end, this paper presents a novel deep scheme consisting of three channels, namely global, wide, and deep ones. The global channel encodes the complete historical information within the given context, the wide one employs an attention-based recurrent neural network model to predict the keywords that may not appear in the historical context, and the deep one trains a Multi-layer Perceptron model to select some keywords for an in-depth discussion. Thereafter, our scheme integrates the outputs of these three channels to generate desired responses. To justify our model, we conducted extensive experiments to compare our model with several state-of-the-art baselines on two datasets: one is constructed by ourselves and the other is a public benchmark dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our model yields promising performance by widening or deepening the topics of interest.

AB With the rapid growth of mobile web search, it is necessary and important to understand user's examination behavior on mobile devices in the absence of clicks. Previous studies used viewport metrics to estimate user's attention. However, there still lacks an in-depth understanding of how search users examine and interact with the mobile SERP. In this work, based on the large-scale real search log collected from a popular commercial mobile search engine, we present a comprehensive analysis of examination behavior. Specifically, we analyze the position bias, the relationship with click behavior, and examination's change as the session continues. The findings shed new light on the understanding of user's examination behavior, and also provide some implication for the improvement and evaluation of mobile search engine.

ID AUTHORSHIP
AB Text mining and information retrieval techniques have been developed to assist us with analyzing, organizing and retrieving documents with the help of computers. In many cases, it is desirable that the authors of such documents remain anonymous: Search logs can reveal sensitive details about a user, critical articles or messages about a company or government might have severe or fatal consequences for a critic, and negative feedback in customer surveys might negatively impact business relations if they are identified. Simply removing personally identifying information from a document is, however, insufficient to protect the writer's identity: Given some reference texts of suspect authors, so-called authorship attribution methods can reidentfy the author from the text itself.
   One of the most prominent models to represent documents in many common text mining and information retrieval tasks is the vector space model where each document is represented as a vector, typically containing its term frequencies or related quantities. We therefore propose an automated text anonymization approach that produces synthetic term frequency vectors for the input documents that can be used in lieu of the original vectors. We evaluate our method on an exemplary text classification task and demonstrate that it only has a low impact on its accuracy. In contrast, we show that our method strongly affects authorship attribution techniques to the level that they become infeasible with a much stronger decline in accuracy. Other than previous authorship obfuscation methods, our approach is the first that fulfills differential privacy and hence comes with a provable plausible deniability guarantee.

AB Retrieval systems have greatly improved over the last half century, estimating relevance to a latent user need in a wide variety of areas. One common task in e-commerce and science that has not enjoyed such advancements is searching through a catalog of items. Finding a desirable item in such a catalog requires that the user specify desirable item properties, specifically desirable attribute values. Existing item retrieval systems assume the user can formulate a good Boolean or SQL-style query to retrieve items, as one would do with a database, but this is often challenging, particularly given multiple numeric attributes. Such systems avoid inferring query intent, instead requiring the user to precisely specify what matches the query. A contrasting approach would be to estimate how well items match the user's latent desires and return items ranked by this estimation. Towards this end, we present a retrieval model inspired by multi-criteria decision making theory, concentrating on numeric attributes. In two user studies (choosing airline tickets and meal plans) using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we evaluate our novel approach against the de facto standard of Boolean retrieval and several models proposed in the literature. We use a novel competitive game to motivate test subjects and compare methods based on the results of the subjects' initial query and their success in the game. In our experiments, our new method significantly outperformed the others, whereas the Boolean approaches had the worst performance.

DE Non-stationary Bandit; Recommender Systems; Regret Analysis
AB Multi-armed bandit algorithms have become a reference solution for handling the explore/exploit dilemma in recommender systems, and many other important real-world problems, such as display advertisement. However, such algorithms usually assume a stationary reward distribution, which hardly holds in practice as users' preferences are dynamic. This inevitably costs a recommender system consistent suboptimal performance. In this paper, we consider the situation where the underlying distribution of reward remains unchanged over (possibly short) epochs and shifts at unknown time instants. In accordance, we propose a contextual bandit algorithm that detects possible changes of environment based on its reward estimation confidence and updates its arm selection strategy respectively. Rigorous upper regret bound analysis of the proposed algorithm demonstrates its learning effectiveness in such a non-trivial environment. Extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets for recommendation confirm its practical utility in a changing environment.

DE deep learning; epidemiology prediction; time series
AB Predicting new and urgent trends in epidemiological data is an important problem for public health, and has attracted increasing attention in the data mining and machine learning communities. The temporal nature of epidemiology data and the need for real-time prediction by the system makes the problem residing in the category of time-series forecasting or prediction. While traditional autoregressive (AR) methods and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) have been actively studied for solving this problem, deep learning techniques have not been explored in this domain. In this paper, we develop a deep learning framework, for the first time, to predict epidemiology profiles in the time-series perspective. We adopt Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to capture the long-term correlation in the data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to fuse information from data of different sources. A residual structure is also applied to prevent overfitting issues in the training process. We compared our model with the most widely used AR models on USA and Japan datasets. Our approach provides consistently better results than these baseline methods.

DE Word Embeddings; Semantic Shifts; Bayesian Surprise
AB Much work has been done recently on learning word embeddings from large corpora, which attempts to find the coordinates of words in a static and high dimensional semantic space. In reality, such corpora often span a sufficiently long time period, during which the meanings of many words may have changed. The co-evolution of word meanings may also result in a distortion of the semantic space, making these static embeddings unable to accurately represent the dynamics of semantics. In this paper, we present a novel computational method to capture such changes and to model the evolution of word semantics.
   Distinct from existing approaches that learn word embeddings independently from time periods and then align them, our method explicitly establishes the stable topological structure of word semantics and identifies the surprising changes in the semantic space over time through a principled statistical method. Empirical experiments on large-scale real-world corpora demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin.

DE Kterm Hashing; Novelty Detection; First Story Detection
AB Kterm Hashing provides an innovative approach to novelty detection on massive data streams. Previous research focused on maximizing the efficiency of Kterm Hashing and succeeded in scaling First Story Detection to Twitter-size data stream without sacrificing detection accuracy. In this paper, we focus on improving the effectiveness of Kterm Hashing. Traditionally, all kterms are considered as equally important when calculating a document's degree of novelty with respect to the past. We believe that certain kterms are more important than others and hypothesize that uniform kterm weights are sub-optimal for determining novelty in data streams. To validate our hypothesis, we parameterize Kterm Hashing by assigning weights to kterms based on their characteristics. Our experiments apply Kterm Hashing in a First Story Detection setting and reveal that parameterized Kterm Hashing can surpass state-of-the-art detection accuracy and significantly outperform the uniformly weighted approach.

DE Web image search; Behavior model; Search logs; User interactions
AB User interaction behavior is a valuable source of implicit relevance feedback. In Web image search a different type of search result presentation is used than in general Web search, which leads to different interaction mechanisms and user behavior. For example, image search results are self-contained, so that users do not need to click the results to view the landing page as in general Web search, which generates sparse click data. Also, two-dimensional result placement instead of a linear result list makes browsing behaviors more complex. Thus, it is hard to apply standard user behavior models (e.g., click models) developed for general Web search to Web image search.
   In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive image search user behavior analysis using data from a lab-based user study as well as data from a commercial search log. We then propose a novel interaction behavior model, called grid-based user browsing model (GUBM), whose design is motivated by observations from our data analysis. GUBM can both capture users' interaction behavior, including cursor hovering, and alleviate position bias. The advantages of GUBM are two-fold: (1) It is based on an unsupervised learning method and does not need manually annotated data for training. (2) It is based on user interaction features on search engine result pages (SERPs) and is easily transferable to other scenarios that have a grid-based interface such as video search engines. We conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of our model using a large-scale commercial image search log. Experimental results show that in terms of behavior prediction (perplexity), and topical relevance and image quality (normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG)), GUBM outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models as well as the original ranking. We make the implementation of GUBM and related datasets publicly available for future studies.

DE Text Understanding; Entity Salience; Entity-Oriented Search
AB This paper presents a Kernel Entity Salience Model (KESM) that improves text understanding and retrieval by better estimating entity salience (importance) in documents. KESM represents entities by knowledge enriched distributed representations, models the interactions between entities and words by kernels, and combines the kernel scores to estimate entity salience. The whole model is learned end-to-end using entity salience labels. The salience model also improves ad hoc search accuracy, providing effective ranking features by modeling the salience of query entities in candidate documents. Our experiments on two entity salience corpora and two TREC ad hoc search datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of KESM over frequency-based and feature-based methods. We also provide examples showing how KESM conveys its text understanding ability learned from entity salience to search.

DE search history visualization; information-refinding; collaborative
   search
AB In this demo paper, we introduce LogCanvas, a platform for user search history visualization.Different from the existing visualization tools, LogCanvas focuses on helping users re-construct the semantic relationship among their search activities. LogCanvas segments a user's search history into different sessions and generates a knowledge graph to represent the information exploration process in each session.A knowledge graph is composed of the most important concepts or entities discovered by each search query as well as their relationships. It thus captures the semantic relationship among the queries. LogCanvas offers a session timeline viewer and a snippets viewer to enable users to re-find their previous search results efficiently. LogCanvas also provides a collaborative perspective to support a group of users in sharing search results and experience.

DE Multimodal Sentiment Analysis; Co-Memory Network; Attention
AB With the rapid increase of diversity and modality of data in usergenerated contents, sentiment analysis as a core area of social media analytics has gone beyond traditional text-based analysis. Multimodal sentiment analysis has become an important research topic in recent years. Most of the existing work on multimodal sentiment analysis extracts features from image and text separately, and directly combine them to train a classifier. As visual and textual information in multimodal data can mutually reinforce and complement each other in analyzing the sentiment of people, previous research all ignores this mutual influence between image and text. To fill this gap, in this paper, we consider the interrelation of visual and textual information, and propose a novel co-memory network to iteratively model the interactions between visual contents and textual words for multimodal sentiment analysis. Experimental results on two public multimodal sentiment datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

DE Multimedia Recommendation; Graph Autoencoder; Content-based Filtering;
   Implicit Feedback
AB Precisely recommending relevant multimedia items from massive candidates to a large number of users is an indispensable yet difficult task on many platforms. A promising way is to project users and items into a latent space and recommend items via the inner product of latent factor vectors. However, previous studies paid little attention to the multimedia content itself and couldn't make the best use of preference data like implicit feedback. To fill this gap, we propose a Content-aware Multimedia Recommendation Model with Graph Autoencoder (GraphCAR), combining informative multimedia content with user-item interaction. Specifically, user-item interaction, user attributes and multimedia contents (e.g., images, videos, audios, etc.) are taken as input of the autoencoder to generate the item preference scores for each user. Through extensive experiments on two real-world multimedia Web services: Amazon and Vine, we show that GraphCAR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques of both collaborative filtering and content-based methods.

AB While increasingly complex approaches to question answering (QA) have been proposed, the true gain of these systems, particularly with respect to their expensive training requirements, can be inflated when they are not compared to adequate baselines. Here we propose an unsupervised, simple, and fast alignment and information retrieval baseline that incorporates two novel contributions: a one-to-many alignment between query and document terms and negative alignment as a proxy for discriminative information. Our approach not only outperforms all conventional baselines as well as many supervised recurrent neural networks, but also approaches the state of the art for supervised systems on three QA datasets. With only three hyperparameters, we achieve 47% P@1 on an 8th grade Science QA dataset, 32.9% P@1 on a Yahoo! answers QA dataset and 64% MAP on WikiQA.

DE Imagination; Sample Construction; Zero-Shot Learning
AB Zero-shot learning (ZSL) which aims to recognize unseen classes with no labeled training sample, efficiently tackles the problem of missing labeled data in image retrieval. Nowadays there are mainly two types of popular methods for ZSL to recognize images of unseen classes: probabilistic reasoning and feature projection. Different from these existing types of methods, we propose a new method: sample construction to deal with the problem of ZSL. Our proposed method, called Imagination Based Sample Construction (IBSC), innovatively constructs image samples of target classes in feature space by mimicking human associative cognition process. Based on an association between attribute and feature, target samples are constructed from different parts of various samples. Furthermore, dissimilarity representation is employed to select high-quality constructed samples which are used as labeled data to train a specific classifier for those unseen classes. In this way, zero-shot learning is turned into a supervised learning problem. As far as we know, it is the first work to construct samples for ZSL thus, our work is viewed as a baseline for future sample construction methods. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show the superiority of our proposed method.

AB Intelligent personal assistant systems with either text-based or voice-based conversational interfaces are becoming increasingly popular around the world. Retrieval-based conversation models have the advantages of returning fluent and informative responses. Most existing studies in this area are on open domain "chit-chat" conversations or task / transaction oriented conversations. More research is needed for information-seeking conversations. There is also a lack of modeling external knowledge beyond the dialog utterances among current conversational models. In this paper, we propose a learning framework on the top of deep neural matching networks that leverages external knowledge for response ranking in information-seeking conversation systems. We incorporate external knowledge into deep neural models with pseudo-relevance feedback and QA correspondence knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments with three information-seeking conversation data sets including both open benchmarks and commercial data show that, our methods outperform various baseline methods including several deep text matching models and the state-of-the-art method on response selection in multi-turn conversations. We also perform analysis over different response types, model variations and ranking examples. Our models and research findings provide new insights on how to utilize external knowledge with deep neural models for response selection and have implications for the design of the next generation of information-seeking conversation systems.

DE Evaluation; Per-Topic Variance; System Comparison
AB Under the notion that the document collection is a sample from a population, the observed per-topic metric (e.g., AP) value varies with different samples, leading to the per-topic variance. The results of the system comparison, such as comparing the ranking of systems according to the summary metric (e.g., MAP) or testing whether there is significant difference between two systems, are affected by the variability of per-topic metric values. In this paper, we study the effect of per-topic variance on the system comparison. To measure such effects, we employ two ranking-based methods, i.e., Error Rate (ER) and Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient (KRCC), as well as two significance test based methods, namely Achieved Significance Level (ASL) and Estimated Difference (ED). We conduct empirical comparison of TREC participated systems on Robust and Adhoc track, which shows that the effect of per-topic variance on the ranking of systems is not obvious, while the significance test based comparisons are susceptible to the per-topic variance.

DE Robust Asymmetric Learning; Concave-Convex Optimization
AB Recommender systems with implicit feedback (e.g. clicks and purchases) suffer from two critical limitations: 1) imbalanced labels may mislead the learning process of the conventional models that assign balanced weights to the classes; and 2) outliers with large reconstruction errors may dominate the objective function by the conventional L-2-norm loss. To address these issues, we propose a robust asymmetric recommendation model. It integrates cost-sensitive learning with capped unilateral loss into a joint objective function, which can be optimized by an iteratively weighted approach. To reduce the computational cost of low-rank approximation, we exploit the dual characterization of the nuclear norm to derive a min-max optimization problem and design a subgradient algorithm without performing full SVD. Finally, promising empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on benchmark recommendation datasets.

DE Question Answering; Information Exchange in Email; Email Reply
   Assistance
AB Email is one of the most important means of online communication. People spend a significant amount of time sending, reading, searching and responding to email to manage tasks, exchange information, etc. In this paper, we focus on information exchange over enterprise email in the form of questions and answers. We study a large scale publicly available email dataset to characterize information exchange via questions and answers in enterprise email. We augment our analysis with a survey to gain insights on the types of questions exchanged, when and how do people get back to them and whether this behavior is adequately supported by existing email management and search functionality. We leverage this understanding to define the task of extracting question/answer pairs from threaded email conversations. We propose a neural network based approach that matches the question to the answer considering comparisons at different levels of granularity. We also show that we can improve the performance by leveraging external data of question and answer pairs. We test our approach using a manually labeled email data collected using a crowd-sourcing annotation study. Our findings have implications for designing email clients and intelligent agents that support question answering and information lookup in email.

DE Intent-aware query obfuscation; privacy protection; personalization
AB We develop Hide-n-Seek, an intent-aware privacy protection plugin for personalized web search. In addition to users' genuine search queries, Hide-n-Seek submits k cover queries and corresponding clicks to an external search engine to disguise a user's search intent grounded and reinforced in a search session by mimicking the true query sequence. The cover queries are synthesized and randomly sampled from a topic hierarchy, where each node represents a coherent search topic estimated by both n-gram and neural language models constructed over crawled web documents. Hide-n-Seek also personalizes the returned search results by re-ranking them based on the genuine user profile developed and maintained on the client side. With a variety of graphical user interfaces, we present the topic-based query obfuscation mechanism to the end users for them to digest how their search privacy is protected.

DE Policy gradient; Antithetic variates; Coordinate gradient
AB Policy gradient, which makes use of Monte Carlo method to get an unbiased estimation of the parameter gradients, has been widely used in reinforcement learning. One key issue in policy gradient is reducing the variance of the estimation. From the viewpoint of statistics, policy gradient with baseline, a successful variance reduction method for policy gradient, directly applies the control variates method, a traditional variance reduction technique used in Monte Carlo, to policy gradient. One problem with control variates method is that the quality of estimation heavily depends on the choice of the control variates. To address the issue and inspired by the antithetic variates method for variance reduction, we propose to combine the antithetic variates method with traditional policy gradient for the multi-armed bandit problem. Furthermore, we achieve a new policy gradient algorithm called Antithetic-Arm Bandit (AAB). In AAB, the gradient is estimated through coordinate ascent where at each iteration gradient of the target arm is estimated through: 1) constructing a sequence of arms which is approximately monotonic in terms of estimated gradients, 2) sampling a pair of antithetic arms over the sequence, and 3) re-estimating the target gradient based on the sampled pair. Theoretical analysis proved that AAB achieved an unbiased and variance reduced estimation. Experimental results based on a multi-armed bandit task showed that AAB can achieve state-of-the-art performances.

ID INFORMATION; RETRIEVAL; MODELS
AB Evidence derived from passages that closely represent likely answers to a posed query can be useful input to the ranking process. Based on a novel use of Community Question Answering data, we present an approach for the creation of such passages. A general framework for extracting answer passages and estimating their quality is proposed, and this evidence is integrated into ranking models. Our experiments on two web collections show that such quality estimates from answer passages provide a strong indication of document relevance and compare favorably to previous passage-based methods. Combining such evidence can significantly improve over a set of state-of-the-art ranking models, including Quality-Biased Ranking, External Expansion, and a combination of both. A final ranking model that incorporates all quality estimates achieves further improvements on both collections.

AB As text data continues to grow quickly, it is increasingly important to develop intelligent systems to help people manage and make use of vast amounts of text data ("big text data"). As a new family of effective general approaches to text data retrieval and analysis, probabilistic topic models-notably Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), Latent Dirichlet Allocations (LDA), and their many extensions-have been studied actively in the past decade with widespread applications. These topic models are powerful tools for extracting and analyzing latent topics contained in text data; they also provide a general and robust latent semantic representation of text data, thus improving many applications in information retrieval and text mining. Since they are general and robust, they can be applied to text data in any natural language and about any topics. This tutorial systematically reviews the major research progress in probabilistic topic models and discuss their applications in text retrieval and text mining. The tutorial provides (1) an in-depth explanation of the basic concepts, underlying principles, and the two basic topic models (i.e., PLSA and LDA) that have widespread applications, (2) an introduction to EM algorithms and Bayesian inference algorithms for topic models, (3) a hands-on exercise to allow the tutorial attendants to learn how to use the topic models implemented in the MeTA Open Source Toolkit and experiment with provided data sets, (4) a broad overview of all the major representative topic models that extend PLSA or LDA, and (5) a discussion of major challenges and future research directions.

DE Web image search; user satisfaction; evaluation metrics
AB Comparing to general Web search engines, image search engines present search results differently, with two-dimensional visual image panel for users to scroll and browse quickly. These differences in result presentation can significantly impact the way that users interact with search engines, and therefore affect existing methods of search evaluation. Although different evaluation metrics have been thoroughly studied in the general Web search environment, how those offline and online metrics reflect user satisfaction in the context of image search is an open question. To shed light on this, we conduct a laboratory user study that collects both explicit user satisfaction feedbacks as well as user behavior signals such as clicks. Based on the combination of both externally assessed topical relevance and image quality judgments, offline image search metrics can be better correlated with user satisfaction than merely using topical relevance. We also demonstrate that existing offline Web search metrics can be adapted to evaluate on a two-dimensional presentation for image search. With respect to online metrics, we find that those based on image click information significantly outperform offline metrics. To our knowledge, our work is the first to thoroughly establish the relationship between different measures and user satisfaction in image search.

AB Ride sharing apps like Uber and Didi Chuxing have played an important role in addressing the users' transportation needs, which come not only in huge volumes, but also in great variety. While some users prefer low-cost services such as carpooling or hitchhiking, others prefer more pricey options like taxi or premier services. Further analyses suggest that such preference may also be associated with different time and location. In this paper, we empirically analyze the preferred services and propose a recommender system which provides service recommendation based on temporal, spatial, and behavioral features. Offline simulations show that our system achieves a high prediction accuracy and reduces the user's effort in finding the desired service. Such a recommender system allows a more precise scheduling for the platform, and enables personalized promotions.

DE Table generation; structured data search; entity-oriented search
AB Many information needs revolve around entities, which would be better answered by summarizing results in a tabular format, rather than presenting them as a ranked list. Unlike previous work, which is limited to retrieving existing tables, we aim to answer queries by automatically compiling a table in response to a query. We introduce and address the task of on-the-fly table generation: given a query, generate a relational table that contains relevant entities (as rows) along with their key properties (as columns). This problem is decomposed into three specific subtasks: (i) core column entity ranking, (ii) schema determination, and (iii) value lookup. We employ a feature-based approach for entity ranking and schema determination, combining deep semantic features with task-specific signals. We further show that these two subtasks are not independent of each other and can assist each other in an iterative manner. For value lookup, we combine information from existing tables and a knowledge base. Using two sets of entity-oriented queries, we evaluate our approach both on the component level and on the end-to-end table generation task.

DE Question Answering; Search Quality; Convolutional Neural Networks
AB Plenty of research attempts target the automatic duplicate detection in Community Question Answering (CQA) systems and frame the task as a supervised learning problem on the question pairs. However, these methods rely on handcrafted features, leading to the difficulty of distinguishing related and duplicate questions as they are often textually similar. To tackle this issue, we propose to leverage neural network architecture to extract "deep" features to identify whether a question pair is duplicate or related. In particular, we construct question correlation matrices, which capture the word-wise similarities between questions. The constructed matrices are input to our proposed convolutional neural network (CNN), in which the convolutional operation moves through the two dimensions of the matrices. Empirical studies on a range of real-world CQA datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed correlation matrices and the CNN. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and achieves better classification performance.

AB Generative adversarial nets (GANs) have been widely studied during the recent development of deep learning and unsupervised learning. With an adversarial training mechanism, GAN manages to train a generative model to fit the underlying unknown real data distribution under the guidance of the discriminative model estimating whether a data instance is real or generated. Such a framework is originally proposed for fitting continuous data distribution such as images, thus it is not straightforward to be directly applied to information retrieval scenarios where the data is mostly discrete, such as IDs, text and graphs. In this tutorial, we focus on discussing the GAN techniques and the variants on discrete data fitting in various information retrieval scenarios. (i) We introduce the fundamentals of GAN framework and its theoretic properties; (ii) we carefully study the promising solutions to extend GAN onto discrete data generation; (iii) we introduce IRGAN, the fundamental GAN framework of fitting single ID data distribution and the direct application on information retrieval; (iv) we further discuss the task of sequential discrete data generation tasks, e.g., text generation, and the corresponding GAN solutions; (v) we present the most recent work on graph/network data fitting with node embedding techniques by GANs. Meanwhile, we also introduce the relevant open-source platforms such as IRGAN and Texygen to help audience conduct research experiments on GANs in information retrieval. Finally, we conclude this tutorial with a comprehensive summarization and a prospect of further research directions for GANs in information retrieval.

AB Explainable recommendation and search attempt to develop models or methods that not only generate high-quality recommendation or search results, but also intuitive explanations of the results for users or system designers, which can help to improve the system transparency, persuasiveness, trustworthiness, and effectiveness, etc. This is even more important in personalized search and recommendation scenarios, where users would like to know why a particular product, web page, news report, or friend suggestion exists in his or her own search and recommendation lists. The workshop focuses on the research and application of explainable recommendation and search, and gathers researchers as well as practitioners in the field for discussions, idea communications, and research promotions.

DE email recommendation; email re-finding; email search
AB In this paper, we study how to leverage calendar information to help with email re-finding using a zero-query prototype, Calendar-Aware Proactive Email Recommender System (CAPERS). CAPERS proactively selects and displays potentially useful emails to users based on their upcoming calendar events with a particular focus on meeting preparation. We approach this problem domain through a survey, a task-based experiment, and a field experiment comparing multiple email recommenders in a large technology company. We first show that a large proportion of email access is related to meetings and then study the effects of four email recommenders on user perception and engagement taking into account four categories of factors: the amount of email content, email recency, calendar-email content match, and calendar-email people match. We demonstrate that these factors all positively predict the usefulness of emails to meeting preparation and that calendar-email content match is the most important. We study the effects of different machine learning models for predicting usefulness and find that an online-learned linear model doubles user engagement compared with the baselines, which suggests the benefit of continuous online learning.

DE Test collection; document ranking; search evaluation
AB Data is of vital importance in the development of machine learning technologies. Recently, within the information retrieval field, a number of neural ranking frameworks have been proposed to address the ad-hoc search. These models usually need a large amount of query-document relevance judgments for training. However, obtaining this kind of relevance judgments needs a lot of money and manual effort. To shed light on this problem, researchers seek to use implicit feedback from users of search engines to improve the ranking performance. In this paper, we present a new dataset, Sogou-QCL, which contains 537,366 queries and five kinds of weak relevance labels for over 12 million query-document pairs. We apply Sogou-QCL dataset to train recent neural ranking models and show its potential to serve as weak supervision for ranking. We believe that Sogou-QCL will have a broad impact on corresponding areas.

DE Search Engine; Virtual Reality; User Interface
AB In this paper, we introduce a Virtual Reality (VR) search engine interface. Virtual reality has been explored in the game industry and in the multimedia community. When wearing a VR device, a realistic experience is simulated around the user. In the working environment, VR's potential is still understudied. As a first step to enable VR-supported working environment, we present a search engine with a virtual reality interface. In our system, users can read, search and interact with the search engine with novel experiences. They only need to use their hands to interact with digital content, just like what is shown in the "minority report" movie.

DE Text Generation; Benchmarking; Evaluation Metrics
AB We introduce Texygen, a benchmarking platform to support research on open-domain text generation models. Texygen has not only implemented a majority of text generation models, but also covered a set of metrics that evaluate the diversity, the quality and the consistency of the generated texts. The Texygen platform could help standardize the research on text generation and improve the reproductivity and reliability of future research work in text generation.

DE Technology Assisted Reviews; Interactive Search; Asking Questions;

AB The goal of a technology-assisted review is to achieve high recall with low human effort. Continuous active learning algorithms have demonstrated good performance in locating the majority of relevant documents in a collection, however their performance is reaching a plateau when 80% -90% of them has been found. Finding the last few relevant documents typically requires exhaustively reviewing the collection. In this paper, we propose a novel method to identify these last few, but significant, documents efficiently. Our method makes the hypothesis that entities carry vital information in documents, and that reviewers can answer questions about the presence or absence of an entity in the missing relevance documents. Based on this we devise a sequential Bayesian search method that selects the optimal sequence of questions to ask. The experimental results show that our proposed method can greatly improve performance requiring less reviewing effort.

DE Crowdsourcing; Self-training; Human in the Loop; Relation Extraction;
   Community Question Answering
AB In this paper, we introduce a general iterative human-machine collaborative method for training crowdsource workers: a classifier (i.e., the machine) selects the highest quality examples for training crowdsource workers (i.e., the humans). Then, the latter annotate the lower quality examples such that the classifier can be re-trained with more accurate examples. This process can be iterated several times. We tested our approach on two different tasks, Relation Extraction and Community Question Answering, which are also in two different languages, English and Arabic, respectively. Our experimental results show a significant improvement for creating Gold Standard data over distant supervision or just crowdsourcing without worker training. Additionally, our method can approach the performance of the state-of-the-art methods that use expensive Gold Standard for training workers.

DE Exploratory Search; Personalization; Faceted Search; Knowledge Bases
AB Faceted Search Systems (FSS) have gained prominence in research as one of the exploratory search approaches that support complex search tasks. They provide facets to educate users about the information space and allow them to refine their search query and navigate back and forth between resources on a single results page. When the information available in the collection being searched across increases, so does the number of associated facets. This can make it impractical to display all of the facets at once.

DE Collection; Venue Suggestion; Context-Awareness
AB Suggesting personalized venues helps users to find interesting places on location-based social networks (LBSNs). Although there are many LBSNs online, none of them is known to have thorough information about all venues. The Contextual Suggestion track at TREC aimed at providing a collection consisting of places as well as user context to enable researchers to examine and compare different approaches, under the same evaluation setting. However, the officially released collection of the track did not meet many participants' needs related to venue content, online reviews, and user context. That is why almost all successful systems chose to crawl information from different LBSNs. For example, one of the best proposed systems in the TREC 2016 Contextual Suggestion track crawled data from multiple LBSNs and enriched it with venue context appropriateness ratings, collected using a crowdsourcing platform. Such collection enabled the system to better predict a venue's appropriateness to a given user's context. In this paper, we release both collections that were used by the system above. We believe that these datasets give other researchers the opportunity to compare their approaches with the top systems in the track. Also, it provides the opportunity to explore different methods to predicting contextually appropriate venues.

AB Despite a decade of research on XML, keyword search (XKS), demonstration of a high quality XKS system has still eluded the information retrieval community. Existing XKS engines primarily suffer from two limitations. First, although the smallest lowest common ancestor (SLCA) algorithm (or a variant, e.g.,ELCA) is widely accepted as a meaningful way to identify subtrees containing the query keywords, SLCA typically performs poorly on documents with missing elements, i.e., (sub)elements that are optional, or appear in some instances of an element type but not all. Second, since keyword search can be ambiguous with multiple possible interpretations, it is desirable for an XKS engine to automatically expand the original query by providing a classification of different possible interpretations of the query w.r.t. the original results. However, existing XKS systems do not support such result-based query expansion. We demonstrate ASTERIX, an innovative XKS engine that addresses these limitations.

DE Facebook Reactions; Social Signals; Social IR; Ranking
AB A large amount of social feedback expressed by social signals (e.g. like, +1, rating) are assigned to web resources. These signals are often exploited as additional sources of evidence in search engines. Our objective in this paper is to study the impact of the new social signals, called Facebook reactions (love, haha, angry, wow, sad) in the retrieval. These reactions allow users to express more nuanced emotions compared to classic signals (e.g. like, share). First, we analyze these reactions and show how users use these signals to interact with posts. Second, we evaluate the impact of each such reaction in the retrieval, by comparing them to both the textual model without social features and the first classical signal (like based model). These social features are modeled as document prior and are integrated into a language model. We conducted a series of experiments on IMDb dataset. Our findings reveal that incorporating social features is a promising approach for improving the retrieval ranking performance.

DE Semantic search; query understanding; query intention; semantic ranking;
   learning to rank
AB Queries are often ambiguous and can be interpreted in many ways, even by humans. Hence, semantic query understanding's primary objective is to understand the intention behind the query. This implies first predicting the language used to express the query. Second, parsing the query according to that language. Third, extracting the entities and concepts mentioned in the query. Finally, based on all this information, we predict one or more possible intentions with a certain probability, which is particularly important for ambiguous queries. These scores will be one of the inputs for the final semantic ranking. For example, given the query "bond", possible results for query understanding are a financial instrument, the movie character, a chemical reaction, or a term for endearment.
   Semantic ranking refers to ranking search results using semantic information. In a standard search engine, a rank is computed by using signals or features coming from the search query, from the documents in the collection being searched and from the search context, such as the language and device being used. Using semantic processing, we also add semantic features that come from concepts present in the knowledge base that appear in the query and semantically match documents in the collection. To do this efficiently, all documents are preprocessed semantically to build an index that includes semantic annotations.
   To accomplish semantic ranking, we use machine learning in several stages. The first stage selects the data sources that we should use to answer the query. In the second stage, each data source generates a set of answers using "learning to rank: The third and final stage ranks these data sources, selecting and ordering the intentions as well as the answers inside each intention (e.g., news) that will appear in the final composite answer. All these techniques are language independent, but may use language dependent features.

DE electrical health record; medical history; string kernels; skip-gram
AB In medical practice, knowing the medical history of a patient is crucial for diagnosis and treatment suggestion. However, such information is often recorded in unstructured notes from doctors, potentially mixed with the medical history of family members and mentions of disorders for other reasons (e.g. as potential side effects). In this work we designed a scheme to automatically extract the medical history of patients from a large healthcare database. More specifically, we first extracted medical conditions mentioned using a rule-based system and a medical gazetteer, then we classified whether such mentions reflected the patient's history or not. We designed our method to be simple and with little human intervention. Our results are very encouraging, supporting the potential for efficient and effective deployment in clinical practice.

DE Test collections; retrieval consistency; semantic effectiveness
AB A search engine that can return the ideal results for a person's information need, independent of the specific query that is used to express that need, would be preferable to one that is overly swayed by the individual terms used; search engines should be consistent in the presence of syntactic query variations responding to the same information need. In this paper we examine the retrieval consistency of a set of five systems responding to syntactic query variations over one hundred topics, working with the UQV100 test collection, and using Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) relative to a centroid ranking over the query variations per topic as a measure of consistency. We also introduce a new data fusion algorithm, Rank-Biased Centroid (RBC), for constructing a centroid ranking over a set of rankings from query variations for a topic. RBC is compared with alternative data fusion algorithms.
   Our results indicate that consistency is positively correlated to a moderate degree with "deep" relevance measures. However, it is only weakly correlated with "shallow" relevance measures, as well as measures of topic complexity and variety in query expression. These findings support the notion that consistency is an independent property of a search engine's retrieval effectiveness.

DE Online social media; Disaster Relief; Microblogs
AB In recent years, several disaster events (e.g., earthquakes in Nepal India and Italy, terror attacks in Paris and Brussels) have proven the crucial role of Online Social Media (OSM) in providing actionable situational information. However, in such media, the crucial information is typically obscured by a lot of insignificant information (e.g., personal opinions, prayers for victims). Moreover, when time is critical, owing to the rapid speed and huge volume of microblogs, it is infeasible for human subjects to go through all the tweets posted. Hence, automated IR methods are needed to extract the relevant information from the deluge of posts.
   Though several methodologies have been developed for tasks like classification, summarization, etc. of social media data posted during disasters [5], there are still several research challenges that need to be addressed for effectively utilising social media data (e.g., microblogs) for aiding disaster relief operations.

DE Controversy Detection; Media Analysis; Behavioral Analysis
AB This paper sets out to detect controversial news reports using online discussions as a source of information. We define controversy as a public discussion that divides society and demonstrate that a content and stylometric analysis of these debates yields useful signals for extracting disputed news items. Moreover, we argue that a debate-based approach could produce more generic models, since the discussion architectures we exploit to measure controversy occur on many different platforms.

DE Topic models; text correspondence modeling; social media; user comments
AB One important way for people to make their voice heard is to comment on the articles they have read online, such as news reports and blogs. The user-generated comments together with the commented documents form a unique correspondence structure. Properly modeling the dependency in such data is thus vital for one to obtain accurate insight of people's opinions and attention. In this work, we develop a Commented Correspondence Topic Model to model correspondence in commented text data. We focus on two levels of correspondence. First, to capture topic-level correspondence, we treat the topic assignments in commented documents as the prior to their comments' topic proportions. This captures the thematic dependency between commented documents and their comments. Second, to capture word-level correspondence, we utilize the Dirichlet compound multinomial distribution to model topics. This captures the word repetition patterns within the commented data. By integrating these two aspects, our model demonstrated encouraging performance in capturing the correspondence structure, which provides improved results in modeling user generated content, spam comment detection, and sentence-based comment retrieval compared with state-of-the-art topic model solutions for correspondence modeling.

AB The large scale of scholarly publications poses a challenge for scholars in information seeking and sensemaking. Bibliometrics, information retrieval (IR), text mining and NLP techniques could help in these search and look-up activities, but are not yet widely used. This workshop is intended to stimulate IR researchers and digital library professionals to elaborate on new approaches in natural language processing, information retrieval, scientometrics, text mining and recommendation techniques that can advance the state-of-the-art in scholarly document understanding, analysis, and retrieval at scale. The BIRNDL workshop at SIGIR 2017 will incorporate an invited talk, paper sessions and the third edition of the Computational Linguistics (CL) Scientific Summarization Shared Task.

DE Display advertising; real-time bidding; ad recommendation; tradeoffs
   optimization
AB Displaying banner advertisements (in short, ads) on webpages has usually been discussed as an Internet economics topic where a publisher uses auction models to sell an online user's page view to advertisers and the one with the highest bid can have her ad displayed to the user. This is also called real-time bidding (RTB) and the ad displaying process ensures that the publisher's benefit is maximized or there is an equilibrium in ad auctions. However, the benefits of the other two stakeholders - the advertiser and the user - have been rarely discussed. In this paper, we propose a two-stage computational framework that selects a banner ad based on the optimized trade-offs among all stakeholders. The first stage is still auction based and the second stage re-ranks ads by considering the benefits of all stakeholders. Our metric variables are: the publisher's revenue, the advertiser's utility, the ad memorability, the ad click-through rate (CTR), the contextual relevance, and the visual saliency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that optimizes trade-offs among all stakeholders in RTB by incorporating multimedia metrics. An algorithm is also proposed to determine the optimal weights of the metric variables. We use both ad auction datasets and multimedia datasets to validate the proposed framework. Our experimental results show that the publisher can significantly improve the other stakeholders' benefits by slightly reducing her revenue in the short-term. In the long run, advertisers and users will be more engaged, the increased demand of advertising and the increased supply of page views can then boost the publisher's revenue.

DE Cover Song Recognition; Dynamic Programming
AB Chroma is a widespread feature for cover song recognition, as it is robust against non-tonal components and independent of timbre and specific instruments. However, Chroma is derived from spectrogram, thus it provides a coarse approximation representation of musical score. In this paper, we proposed a similar but more effective feature Note Class Profile (NCP) derived with music transcription techniques. NCP is a multi-dimensional time serie, each column of which denotes the energy distribution of 12 note classes. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrated its superior performance over existing music features. In addition, NCP feature can be enhanced further with the development of music transcription techniques. The source code can be found in github(1).

DE Digital Advertising; Ad Tech; Big Data
AB In the past decades', we found ourselves spending more and more time on the Internet. As we surf the Internet longer, we are exposed to digital advertisement more. Some of us got used to it and even take it for granted. And some of us sought for a remedy and use ad-blocking software. This could be an end of story, especially if we were not computer scientists who care about information relevance.
   Who are making those advertisements? And why? We know that the television networks make money by broadcasting tv commercial to their viewers. They use the money to create contents and make profit. Therefore, it is obvious that we watch commercial to watch their shows. Of course, some ad-free television networks make funds from monthly subscription fee.
   But why do we feel that we see more ads online than before? Are we right about it? The answer is Yes. We are seeing more ads than before and it is not only because we spend more time online but also because more marketing money has shifted from offline to online marketing.
   The increase in digital marketing is due to several reasons; 1) increase of time spent online 2) descent of publishers' offline business 3) innovations in digital advertising technology and creatives.
   In this talk, I will talk about the history of digital advertising and the recent innovations in advertising technologies to make ads more relevant to individual viewer. Also, I will explain why the advanced machine learning and massive user data are behind the innovations.

AB TheInternet provides developers of connected software, including web sites, applications, and devices, an unprecedented opportunity to accelerate innovation by evaluating ideas quickly and accurately using controlled experiments, also known as A/B tests. From front-end user-interface changes to backend algorithms, from search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, Yahoo!) to retailers (e.g., Amazon, eBay, Etsy) to social networking services (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter) to travel services (e.g., Expedia, Airbnb, Booking.com) to many startups, online controlled experiments are now utilized to make data-driven decisions at a wide range of companies. While the theory of a controlled experiment is simple, and dates back to Sir Ronald A. Fisher's experiments at the Rothamsted Agricultural Experimental Station in England in the 1920s, the deployment and evaluation of online controlled experiments at scale (100's of concurrently running experiments) across variety of web sites, mobile apps, and desktop applications presents many pitfalls and new research challenges.
   In this tutorial we will give an introduction to A/B testing, share key lessons learned from scaling experimentation at Bing to thousands of experiments per year, present real examples, and outline promising directions for future work. The tutorial will go beyond applications of A/B testing in information retrieval and will also discuss on practical and research challenges arising in experimentation on web sites and mobile and desktop apps.
   Our goal in this tutorial is to teach attendees how to scale experimentation for their teams, products, and companies, leading to better data-driven decisions. We also want to inspire more academic research in the relatively new and rapidly evolving field of online controlled experimentation.

AB Spotify provides users with access to a massive repository of streaming music. While some aspects of music access are familiar to the information retrieval community (e.g. semistructured data, item recommendation), nuances of the music domain require the development of new models of user understanding, intent modeling, relevance, and content understanding. These models can be studied using the large amount of content and usage data at Spotify, allowing us to extend previous results in the music information retrieval community. In this presentation, we will highlight the research involved in developing Spotify and outline a research program for large scale music access.

AB Sentence ordering (SO) is a key component of verbal ability. It is also crucial for automatic text generation. While numerous researchers developed various methods to automatically evaluate the informativeness of the produced contents, the evaluation of readability is usually performed manually. In contrast to that, we present a self-sufficient metric for SO assessment based on text topic-comment structure. We show that this metric has high accuracy.

DE Image Search; Map Search; Geographic Information Retrieval
AB Image search is a popular application on web search engines. Issuing a location-related query in image search engines often returns multiple images of maps among the top ranked results. Traditionally, clicking on such images either opens the image in a new browser tab or takes users to a web page containing the image. However, finding the area of intent on an interactive web map is a manual process. In this paper, we describe a novel system, LiveMaps, for analyzing and retrieving an appropriate map view port for a given image of a map. This allows annotation of images of maps returned by image search engines, allowing users to directly open a link to an interactive map centered on the location of interest. LiveMaps works in several stages. It first checks whether the input image represents a map. If yes, then the system attempts to identify what geographical area this map image represents. In the process, we use textual as well as visual information extracted from the image. Finally, we construct an interactive map object capturing the geographical area inferred for the image. Evaluation results on a dataset of high ranked location images indicate our system constructs very precise map representations also achieving good levels of coverage.

AB In the past decade, the use of social media networks (e.g. Twitter) increased dramatically becoming the main channels for the mass public to express their opinions, ideas and preferences, especially during an election or a referendum [5, 7]. Both researchers and the public are interested in understanding what topics are discussed during a real social event [10], what are the trends of the discussed topics [8] and what is the future topical trend [9]. Indeed, modelling such topics as well as trends offer opportunities for social scientists to continue a long-standing research, i.e. examine the information exchange between people in different communities (e.g. in [6]).

AB Understanding the factors comprising IR system effectiveness is of primary importance to compare different IR systems. Effectiveness is traditionally broken down, using ANOVA, into a topic and a system effect but this leaves out a key component of our evaluation paradigm: the collections of documents. We break down effectiveness into topic, system and sub-corpus effects and compare it to the traditional break down, considering what happens when different evaluation measures come into play. We found that sub-corpora are a significant effect. The consideration of which allows us to be more accurate in estimating what systems are significantly different. We also found that the sub-corpora affect different evaluation measures in different ways and this may impact on what systems are considered significantly different.

AB The amount of available data grows every day. The data can help to make better decisions. However, with growing volume and variety it becomes increasingly more difficult to find the necessary data.
   Traditional search engines such as ElasticSearch or Apache Solr are primarily designed to search for text documents. Whereas a search for data has its own specifics: there is less text and more structure. Knoema's search engine is designed specifically to search for data by leveraging data's structure in order to get better results compared to document-oriented search engines.

AB We present a system for identifying interesting social media posts on Twitter and delivering them to users' mobile devices in real time as push notifications. In our problem formulation, users are interested in broad topics such as politics, sports, and entertainment: our system processes tweets in real time to identify relevant, novel, and salient content. There are three interesting aspects to our work: First, instead of attempting to tame the cacophony of unfiltered tweets, we exploit a smaller, but still sizeable, collection of curated tweet streams corresponding to the Twitter accounts of different media outlets. Second, we apply distant supervision to extract topic labels from curated streams that have a specific focus, which can then be leveraged to build high-quality topic classifiers essentially "for free". Finally, our system delivers content via Twitter direct messages, supporting in situ interactions modeled after conversations with intelligent agents. These ideas are demonstrated in an end-to-end working prototype.

AB People regularly use web search and social media to investigate health related issues. This type of Internet data might contain misinformation i.e. incorrect information which contradicts current established medical understanding. If people are influenced by the presented misinformation in these sources, they can make harmful decisions about their health. My research goal is to investigate the effect of Internet data on people's health. Working with my colleagues on this topic, our current findings suggest that there is a potential for people to be harmed by search engine results. Furthermore, we successfully built a high precision approach to track misinformation in social media. In this paper, I briefly discuss my current work including background key references. Thereafter, I propose a research plan to understand possible mechanisms of misinformation's effect on people and its possible impacts on public health. Later, I will explain the suggested research methodology to achieve the research plan.

DE Sentiment spikes; test collections; social media
AB The advent of social media has given the opportunity to users to publicly express and share their opinion about any topic. Public opinion is very important for the interested entities that can leverage such information in the process of making decisions. In addition, identifying sentiment changes and the likely causes that have triggered them allows interested parties to adjust their strategies and attract more positive sentiment. With the aim to facilitate research on this problem, we describe a collection of tweets that can be used for detecting and ranking the likely triggers of sentiment spikes towards different entities. To build the collection, we first group tweets by topic which are then manually annotated according to sentiment polarity and strength. We believe that this collection can be useful for further research on detecting sentiment change triggers, sentiment analysis and sentiment prediction.

AB Recommenders are becoming one of the main ways to navigate the Internet. They recommend appropriate items to users based on their clicks, i.e., likes, ratings, purchases, etc. These clicks are key to providing relevant recommendations and, in this sense, have a signifficant utility. Since clicks reflect the preferences of users, they also raise privacy concerns. At first glance, there seems to be an inherent trade-off between the utility and privacy effects of a click. Nevertheless, a closer look reveals that the situation is more subtle: some clicks do improve utility without compromising privacy, whereas others decrease utility while hampering privacy.
   In this paper, for the first time, we propose a way to quantify the exact utility and privacy effects of each user click. More speciffically, we show how to compute the privacy effect (disclosure risk) of a click using an information-theoretic approach, as well as its utility, using a commonality-based approach. We determine precisely when utility and privacy are antagonist and when they are not. To illustrate our metrics, we apply them to recommendation traces from Movielens and Jester datasets. We show, for instance, that, considering the Movielens dataset, 5.94% of the clicks improve the recommender utility without loss of privacy, whereas 16.43% of the clicks induce a high privacy risk without any utility gain.
   An appealing application of our metrics is what we call a click-advisor, a visual user-aware clicking platform that helps users decide whether it is actually worth clicking on an item or not (after evaluating its potential utility and privacy effects using our techniques). Using a game-theoretic approach, we evaluate several user clicking strategies. We highlight in particular what we define as a smart strategy, leading to a Nash equilibrium, where every user reaches the maximum possible privacy while preserving the average overall recommender utility for all users (with respect to the case where user clicks are based solely on their genuine preferences, i.e., without consulting the click-advisor).

AB Electronic commerce continues to gain popularity in recent years. On eBay, one of the largest on-line marketplaces in the world, millions of new listings (items) are submitted by a variety of sellers every day. This renders a rich diverse inventory characterized by a particularly long tail [7]. In addition, many items in the inventory lack basic structured information, such as product identifiers, brand, category, and other properties, due to sellers' tendency to input unstructured information only, namely title and description [6]. Such inventory therefore requires a handful of large-scale solutions to assist in organizing the data and gaining business insights.
   In 2016, eBay acquired SalesPredict to help structure its unstructured data. In this proposed presentation, we will share the story of a research startup from its inception until its acquisition and integration as eBay's data science team. We will review the numerous challenges from research and engineering perspectives of a startup and the principal challenges the eBay data science organization deals with today. These include the identification of duplicate, similar, and related products; the extraction of name value attributes from item titles and descriptions; the matching of items entered by sellers to catalog products; the ranking of item titles based on their likelihood to serve as "good" product titles; and the creation of "browse node" pages to address complex search queries from potential buyers. We will describe how the eBay data science team approaches these challenges and some of the solutions already launched to production. These solutions involve the use of large-scale machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing techniques, and should therefore be of interest to the SIGIR audience at large.

AB We present a new large-scale collection of 54,772 queries with manually annotated spelling corrections. For 9,170 of the queries (16.74%), spelling variants that are different to the original query are proposed. With its size, our new corpus is an order of magnitude larger than other publicly available query spelling corpora. In addition to releasing the new large-scale corpus, we also provide an implementation of the winner of the Microsoft Speller Challenge from 2011 and compare it on the different publicly available corpora to spelling corrections mined from Google and Bing. This way, we also shed some light on the spelling correction performance of state-of-the-art commercial search systems.

DE Query length; Halo; A/B testing; Research replication
AB People tend to type short queries, however, the belief is that longer queries are more effective. Consequently, a number of attempts have been made to encourage and motivate people to enter longer queries. While most have failed, a recent attempt - conducted in a laboratory setup - in which the query box has a halo or glow effect, that changes as the query becomes longer, has been shown to increase query length by one term, on average. In this paper, we test whether a similar increase is observed when the same component is deployed in a production system for site search and used by real end users. To this end, we conducted two separate experiments, where the rate at which the color changes in the halo were varied. In both experiments users were assigned to one of two conditions: halo and no-halo. The experiments were ran over a fifty day period with 3,506 unique users submitting over six thousand queries. In both experiments, however, we observed no significant difference in query length. We also did not find longer queries to result in greater retrieval performance. While, we did not reproduce the previous findings, our results indicate that the query halo effect appears to be sensitive to performance and task, limiting its applicability to other contexts.

   channel matching
AB Smart TVs are rapidly replacing conventional TVs. In a number of countries, set-top boxes (STB) are widely used to relay TV channels to smart TVs. In such cases, smart TVs cannot identify which TV channel they are receiving. This situation makes it challenging for smart TVs to provide their users with a variety of personalized services, such as context-aware services and recommendation services. In this paper, we introduce our TV channel matching system that resolves such problems. We propose strategies for scaling-out the matching system and improving its accuracy.

DE social media; user interest; topical package; route planning
AB Travel route planning aims to mine user's attributes and recommend personalized routes. How to build interest model for users and understand their real intention brings great challenges. This paper presents an approach which mines the user interest mo del by multi-source social media (e.g., travelogues and check-in records), and understands the user's real intention by active behavior such as point of interest (POI) inputs. In order to unify heterogeneous data from different sources, a topical package is built as the measurement space. Based on the topical package, user topical package is modeled to find user interest and route topical package is constructed to describe the attributes of each route. User's active behavior can also be considered during route planning, where top ranked routes are finally recommended. The proposed multi-source topical package (MSTP) approach is evaluated on a real dataset and compared with two state-of-the-art methods. The result shows that MSTP performs better for providing personalized travel routes.

DE Recommender systems; poisson regression; item-item correlations
AB Top-N recommendation tasks aim to solve the information overload problem for users in the information age. As a user's decision may be affected by correlations among items, we incorporate such correlations with the user and item latent factors to propose a Poisson-regression-based method for top-N recommendation tasks. By placing priori knowledge and using a sparse structure assumption, this method learns the latent factors and the structure of the item-item correlation matrix through the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The preliminary experimental results on two real-world datasets show the improved performance of our approach.

AB Topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been widely used in information retrieval for tasks ranging from smoothing and feedback methods to tools for exploratory search and discovery. However, classical methods for inferring topic models do not scale up to the massive size of today's publicly available Web-scale data sets. The state-of-the-art approaches rely on custom strategies, implementations and hardware to facilitate their asynchronous, communication-intensive workloads.
   We present APS-LDA, which integrates state-of-the-art topic modeling with cluster computing frameworks such as Spark using a novel asynchronous parameter server. Advantages of this integration include convenient usage of existing data processing pipelines and eliminating the need for disk writes as data can be kept in memory from start to finish. Our goal is not to outperform highly customized implementations, but to propose a general high-performance topic modeling framework that can easily be used in today's data processing pipelines.

DE Wikipedia; entity dating; temporal link analysis
AB Wikipedia is the result of collaborative effort aiming to represent human knowledge and to make it accessible to the public. Many Wikipedia articles however lack key metadata information. For example, relatively large number of people described in Wikipedia have no information on their birth and death dates. We propose in this paper to estimate entity's lifetimes using link structure in Wikipedia focusing on person entities. Our approach is based on propagating temporal information over links between Wikipedia articles.

DE Conversational Search; Information Retrieval; Discourse and Dialogue
AB Recent advances in commercial conversational services that allow naturally spoken and typed interaction, particularly for well-formulated questions and commands, have increased the need for more human-centric interactions in information retrieval. The First International Workshop on Conversational Approaches to Information Retrieval (CAIR'17) brings together academic and industrial researchers to create a forum for research on conversational approaches to search. A specific focus is on techniques that support complex and multi-turn user-machine dialogues for information access and retrieval, and multi-model interfaces for interacting with such systems. We invite submissions addressing all modalities of conversation, including speech-based, text-based, and multimodal interaction. We also welcome studies of human-human interaction (e.g., collaborative search) that can inform the design of conversational search applications, and work on evaluation of conversational approaches.

DE Search Portal; User Understanding; Common Interest Group; Deep Learning
AB Naver has been the most popular search engine for over a decade in South Korea. As a search portal, Naver aims to match a user's search intentions to the information from the web pages and databases, and to connect users based on shared interests to provide the best way to find the information. Over the past decade, Naver has been trying to better understand Korean users, queries, and web pages for PC and mobile search. In 2002, Naver introduced Knowledge-IN, which was the forerunner of community Question Answering to find out the need of users and topic experts. Users can ask their specific inquiry to appropriate topic experts in their search results.
   In addition to PC and mobile, Naver is trying to enable a user to access the relevant information using any other device or interface. In detecting common interest groups and good creators, Naver adds device and interface factors. Not only the contents, but also the delivery media types are important in satisfying users on various devices. Deep learning (DL) based methods have tremendous progress in image and text classification. With DL based methods, not only queries, and text documents, but also images, videos, live-streams, locations, etc. are classified and linked to detect common interest groups, and select and rank good creators and good delivery types in each group. With DL, Naver seeks to provide search results that meet user needs more precisely while learning and improving on the fly. In this talk, I'll cover some efforts and challenges in understanding and satisfying users on various devices.

DE community question answering; long short-term memory; question answering
AB Recent advances in neural networks, along with the growth of rich and diverse community question answering (cQA) data, have enabled researchers to construct robust open-domain question answering (QA) systems. It is often claimed that such state-of-the-art QA systems far outperform traditional IR baselines such as BM25. However, most such studies rely on relatively small data sets, e.g., those extracted from the old TREC QA tracks. Given massive training data plus a separate corpus of Q&A pairs as the target knowledge source, how well would such a system really perform? How fast would it respond? In this demonstration, we provide the attendees of SIGIR 2017 an opportunity to experience a live comparison of two open-domain QA systems, one based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture with over 11 million Yahoo! Chiebukuro (i.e., Japanese Yahoo! Answers) questions and over 27.4 million answers for training, and the other based on BM25. Both systems use the same Q&A knowledge source for answer retrieval. Our core demonstration system is a pair of Japanese monolingual QA systems, but we leverage machine translation for letting the SIGIR attendees enter English questions and compare the Japanese responses from the two systems after translating them into English.

AB This full-day tutorial provides general instruction about the design of controlled laboratory experiments that are conducted in order to better understand human information interaction and retrieval. Different data collection methods and procedures are described, with an emphasis on self-report measures and scales. This tutorial also introduces the use of statistical power analysis for sample size estimation and introduces and demonstrate two data analysis procedures, Multilevel Modeling and Structural Equation Modeling, that allow for examination of the whole set of variables present in interactive information retrieval (IIR) experiments, along with their various effect sizes. The goals of the tutorial are to increase participants' (1) understanding of the uses of controlled laboratory experiments with human participants; (2) understanding of the technical vocabulary and procedures associated with such experiments and (3) confidence in conducting and evaluating IIR experiments. Ultimately, we hope our tutorial will increase research capacity and research quality in IR by providing instruction about best practices to those contemplating interactive IR experiments.

AB Measures of node ranking, such as personalized PageRank, are utilized in many web and social-network based prediction and recommendation applications. Despite their effectiveness when the underlying graph is certain, however, these measures become difficult to apply in the presence of uncertainties, as they are not designed for graphs that include uncertain information, such as edges that mutually exclude each other. While there are several ways to naively extend existing techniques (such as trying to encode uncertainties as edge weights or computing all possible scenarios), as we discuss in this paper, these either lead to large degrees of errors or are very expensive to compute, as the number of possible worlds can grow exponentially with the amount of uncertainty. To tackle with this challenge, in this paper, we propose an efficient Uncertain Personalized PageRank (UPPR) algorithm to approximately compute personalized PageRank values on an uncertain graph with edge uncertainties. UPPR avoids enumeration of all possible worlds, yet it is able to achieve comparable accuracy by carefully encoding edge uncertainties in a data structure that leads to fast approximations. Experimental results show that UPPR is very efficient in terms of execution time and its accuracy is comparable or better than more costly alternatives.

DE retrieval based sequence to sequence learning; follow-up question
   resolution; query reformulation; intelligent personal assistants;
   interactive question answering
AB Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) and interactive question answering (IQA) systems frequently encounter incomplete follow-up questions. The incomplete follow-up questions only make sense when seen in conjunction with the conversation context: the previous question and answer. Thus, IQA and IPA systems need to utilize the conversation context in order to handle the incomplete follow-up questions and generate an appropriate response. In this work, we present a retrieval based sequence to sequence learning system that can generate the complete (or intended) question for an incomplete follow-up question (given the conversation context). We can train our system using only a small labeled dataset (with only a few thousand conversations), by decomposing the original problem into two simpler and independent problems. The first problem focuses solely on selecting the candidate complete questions from a library of question templates (built offline using the small labeled conversations dataset). In the second problem, we re-rank the selected candidate questions using a neural language model (trained on millions of unlabelled questions independently). Our system can achieve a BLEU score of 42.91, as compared to 29.11 using an existing generation based approach. We further demonstrate the utility of our system as a plug-in module to an existing QA pipeline. Our system when added as a plug-in module, enables Siri to achieve an improvement of 131.57% in answering incomplete follow-up questions.

DE Email search; Query Expansion
AB This work studies the effectiveness of query expansion for email search. Three state-of-the-art expansion methods are examined: 1) a global translation-based expansion model; 2) a personalized-based word embedding model; 3) the classical pseudo-relevance-feedback model. Experiments were conducted with two mail datasets extracted from a large query log of a Web mail service. Our results demonstrate the significant contribution of query expansion for measuring the similarity between the query and email messages. On the other hand, the contribution of expansion methods for a well trained learning-to-rank scoring function that exploits many relevance signals, was found to be modest.

AB The session search task aims at best serving the user's information need given her previous search behavior during the session. We propose an extended relevance model that captures the user's dynamic information need in the session. Our relevance modelling approach is directly driven by the user's query reformulation (change) decisions and the estimate of how much the user's search behavior affects such decisions. Overall, we demonstrate that, the proposed approach significantly boosts session search performance.

AB With the pervasive availability of smart devices, billions of users' trajectories are recorded and collected. The aggregated human behaviors reveal users' interests and characteristics, becoming invaluable to relied their demographic preference, i.e., gender, age, marital status and even personality, occupation. Occupation profiling from trajectory data is an attractive option for advertisement targeting and other applications, without severe privacy concerns. However, it carries great difficulties in sparsity and vagueness. This paper proposes a novel approach, i.e., SPOT (Selecting occuPation frOm Trajectories). We first carefully analyze and report the trajectory pattern variance of different occupational categories in a large real dataset. And then we design novel ways to extract users content, location and transition preference, and finally illustrate a comprehensive occupation prediction method, Continuous Conditional Random Fields (C-CRF) based prediction model. Empirical studies confirm that the new approach works surprisingly well, and it shows the discriminative power of trajectory data to reveal occupational preference.

DE app reviews; manipulation; crowdsourcing; user behavior
AB With the rapid adoption of smartphones worldwide and the reliance on app marketplaces to discover new apps, these marketplaces are critical for connecting users with apps. And yet, the user reviews and ratings on these marketplaces may be strategically targeted by app developers. We investigate the use of crowdsourcing platforms to manipulate app reviews. We find that (i) apps targeted by crowd sourcing platforms are rated significantly higher on average than other apps; (ii) the reviews themselves arrive in bursts; (iii) app reviewers tend to repeat themselves by relying on some standard repeated text; and (iv) apps by the same developer tend to share a more similar language model: if one app has been targeted, it is likely that many of the other apps from the same developer have also been targeted.

AB Document ranking is a central problem in many areas, including information retrieval and recommendation. The goal of learning to rank is to automatically create ranking models from training data. The performance of ranking models is strongly affected by the quality and quantity of training data. Collecting large scale training samples with relevance labels involves human labor which is time-consuming and expensive. Selective sampling and active learning techniques have been developed and proven effective in addressing this problem. However, most active methods do not scale well and need to rebuild the model after selected samples are added to the previous training set. We propose a sampling method which selects a set of instances and labels the full set only once before training the ranking model. Our method is based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering (average linkage) and we also report the performance of other linkage criteria that measure the distance between two clusters of query-document pairs. Another difference from previous hierarchical clustering is that we cluster the instances belonging to the same query, which usually outperforms the baselines.

DE Visualization; Test Collections; Pooling Method; Pooling Strategies
AB Every year more than 25 test collections are built among the main Information Retrieval (IR) evaluation campaigns. They are extremely important in IR because they become the evaluation praxis for the forthcoming years. Test collections are built mostly using the pooling method. The main advantage of this method is that it drastically reduces the number of documents to be judged. It does so at the cost of introducing biases, which are sometimes aggravated by non optimal configuration. In this paper we develop a novel visualization technique for the pooling method, and integrate it in a demo application named Visual Pool. This demo application enables the user to interact with the pooling method with ease, and develops visual hints in order to analyze existing test collections, and build better ones.

DE social events; volume dynamics; content information; early prediction
AB Social media has become one of the most credible sources for delivering messages, breaking news, as well as events. Predicting the future dynamics of an event at a very early stage is significantly valuable, e.g, helping company anticipate marketing trends before the event becomes mature. However, this prediction is non-trivial because a) social events always stay with ''noise" under the same topic and b) the information obtained at its early stage is too sparse and limited to support an accurate prediction. In order to overcome these two problems, in this paper, we design an event early embedding model (EEEM) that can 1) extract social events from noise, 2) find the previous similar events, and 3) predict future dynamics of a new event. Extensive experiments conducted on a large-scale dataset of Twitter data demonstrate the capacity of our model on extract events and the promising performance of prediction by considering both volume information as well as content information.

AB Web Mail has significantly changed in the last decade. It keeps growing with 90% of its traffic being generated by automated scripts or "machines", [1]. At the same time, major mail services offer more and more free storage, ranging from 15GB for Gmail and Outlook. com to 1TB for Yahoo mail. As a result, we keep accumulating messages in our inbox, rarely deleting (and sometimes not even opening) many, [2]. Our inbox has become a big store mixing important information, such as e-tickets or bills, together with newsletters or promotions, from which we forgot to unsubscribe. Search is therefore a critical mechanism in order to retrieve the specific messages we need. Unfortunately, search in mail is far from being as trusted (and used) as in the Web today. Everything is personal and often private, from the content of the mailbox, to the search strategies, users' needs and queries, thus making traditional Web search techniques inapplicable "as is". Failure is evident when we can't find a message that we remember having read, and this increases our frustration. Most mail search services return sorted-by-time results in order for us to scan results chronologically and increase our perception of perfect recall. At the same time, the ranking mechanism drops less relevant results, in order to prevent them from being ranked first if recent. So in order to increase a (false) perception of recall, these systems actually hurt recall! Ranking results by mail-specific relevance would actually increase search success, [3] yet it is not widely adopted, with the exceptions of Inbox by Gmail and Yahoo Mail that show a few relevant results on top of traditional ranked-by-time results [4]. In addition, many of us still struggle with expressing our needs, typically issuing very short queries, like in the early days of the Web [5]. In this talk, I will first highlight the key characteristics of mail search and how they differ from Web search, in terms of searchers' needs and behavior [2,5]. I will then present recent progress in mail ranking [3,4] as well as in query assistance tools [5,6]. Finally, I will discuss directions for future research, and the need to revisit mail search and invent search mechanisms specifically tailored to the personal data store that our inbox has become.

DE Tail Latency; Efficiency; Scalability
AB With the growing popularity of the world-wide-web and the increasing accessibility of smart devices, data is being generated at a faster rate than ever before. This presents scalability challenges to web-scale search systems how can we efficiently index, store and retrieve such a vast amount of data? A large amount of prior research has attempted to address many facets of this question, with the invention of a range of efficient index storage and retrieval frameworks that are able to efficiently answer most queries. However, the current literature generally focuses on improving the mean or median query processing time in a given system. In the proposed PhD project, we focus on improving the efficiency of high percentile tail latencies in large scale IR systems while minimising end-to-end effectiveness loss.

AB We present an Euclidean embedding image representation, which serves to rank auction item images through wide range of semantic similarity spectrum, in the order of the relevance to the given query image much more effective than the baseline method in terms of a graded relevance measure. Our method uses three stream deep convolutional siamese networks to learn a distance metric and we leverage search query logs of an auction item search of the largest auction service in Japan. Unlike previous approaches, we define the inter-image relevance on the basis of user queries in the logs used to search each auction item, which enables us to acquire the image representation preserving the features concerning user intents in real e-commerce world.

DE Information Retrieval; word2vec; Feature Engineering
AB We introduce CitySearcher, a vertical search engine that searches for cities when queried for an interest. Generally in search engines, utilization of semantics between words is favorable for performance improvement. Even though ambiguous query words have multiple semantic meanings, search engines can return diversified results to satisfy different users' information needs. But for CitySearcher, mismatched semantic relationships can lead to extremely unsatisfactory results. For example, the city Sale would incorrectly rank high for the interest shopping because of semantic interpretations of the words. Thus in our system, the main challenge is to eliminate the mismatched semantic relationships resulting from the side effect of the semantic models. In the previous case, we aim to ignore the semantics of a city's name which is not indicative of the city's characteristics. In CitySearcher, we use word2vec, a very popular word embedding technique to estimate the semantics of the words and create the initial ranks of the cities. To reduce the effect of the mismatched semantic relationships, we generate a set of features for learning based on a novel clustering-based method. With the generated features, we then utilize learning to rank algorithms to rerank the cities for return. We use the English version of Wikivoyage dataset for evaluation of our system, where we sample a very small dataset for training. Experimental results demonstrate the performance gain of our system over various standard retrieval techniques.

AB In recent years, vast amounts of user-generated data have being created on Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) such as Yelp and Foursquare. Making effective personalised venue suggestions to users based on their preferences and surrounding context is a challenging task. Context-Aware Venue Recommendation (CAVR) is an emerging topic that has gained a lot of attention from researchers, where context can be the user's current location for example. Matrix Factorisation (MF) is one of the most popular collaborative filtering based techniques, which can be used to predict a user's rating on venues by exploiting explicit feedback (e.g. users' ratings on venues). However, such explicit feedback may not be available, particularly for inactive users, while implicit feedback is easier to obtain from LBSNs as it does not require the users to explicitly express their satisfaction with the venues. In addition, the MF-based approaches usually suffer from the sparsity problem where users/venues have very few rating, hindering the prediction accuracy. Although previous works on user-venue rating prediction have proposed to alleviate the sparsity problem by leveraging user-generated data such as social information from LBSNs, research that investigates the usefulness of Deep Neural Network algorithms (DNN) in alleviating the sparsity problem for CAVR remains untouched or partially studied.

When a user searches for an entity, the existing systems usually provide a list of related entities, but they do not necessarily give explanations of how they are related. However, with the help of knowledge graphs, we can generate relatedness graphs between any pair of existing entities. Existing methods of this problem are either graph-based or list based, but they all have some limitations when dealing with large complex relatedness graphs of two related entity. In this work, we investigate how to summarize the relatedness graphs and how to use the summarized graphs to assistant the users to retrieve target information. We also implemented our approach in an online query system and performed experiments and evaluations on it. The results show that our method produces much better result than previous work.

AB In recent years, the information retrieval (IR) community has witnessed the first successful applications of deep neural network models to short-text matching and ad-hoc retrieval tasks. However, the two communities focused on deep neural networks and on IR have less in common when it comes to the choice of programming languages. Indri, an indexing framework popularly used by the IR community, is written in C++, while Torch, a popular machine learning library for deep learning, is written in the light-weight scripting language Lua. To bridge this gap, we introduce Luandri (pronounced "laundry"), a simple interface for exposing the search capabilities of Indri to Torch models implemented in Lua.

AB We. adopt the generalized Pareto distribution for the information-based model and show that the parameters can be estimated based on the mean excess function. The proposed information retrieval model corresponds to the extension of the divergence from independence and is designed to be data-driven. The proposed model is then applied to the specific object search called the instance search and the effectiveness is experimentally confirmed.

AB The efficient indexing of large and sparse N-gram datasets is crucial in several applications in Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Because of the stringent efficiency requirements, dealing with billions of N-grams poses the challenge of introducing a compressed representation that preserves the query processing speed.
   In this paperwe study the problem of reducing the space required by the representation of such datasets, maintaining the capability of looking up for a given N-gram within micro seconds. For this purpose we describe compressed, exact and lossless data structures that achieve, at the same time, high space reductions and no time degradation with respect to state-of-the-art software packages. In particular, we present a trie data structure in which each word following a context of fixed length k, i. e., its preceding k words, is encoded as an integer whose value is proportional to the number of words that follow such context. Since the number of words following a given context is typically very small in natural languages, we are able to lower the space of representation to compression levels that were never achieved before. Despite the significant savings in space, we show that our technique introduces a negligible penalty at query time.

AB In this talk I will describe "Twicalli", a real-time earthquake detection system based on citizen sensors. This system is publicly available for over a year, at http://twicalli.cl, and is currently in use as a decision support tool by the National Seismology Office and by the Hydrographic and the Oceanographic Service in Chile.
   The novelty of our system relies on the fact that it has a very good precision and recall tradeoff for earthquakes of all magnitude ranges that were reported on Twitter. Our earthquake detection methodology is simple, efficient, unsupervised, and it can detect earthquakes reported globally in any language and any region. This complements existing approaches that are either: i) supervised and customized to a particular geographical region, which makes them very expensive to scale geographically and keep up-to-date, or ii) unsupervised with low earthquake recall. The evaluation of our system, performed during a 9-month period, shows that our solution is competitive to the best state-of-the-art methods, providing very good precision and recall performance for a wide range of earthquake magnitudes.

AB Online learning to rank for information retrieval has shown great promise in optimization of Web search results based on user interactions. However, online learning to rank has been used only in the monolingual setting where queries and documents are in the same language. In this work, we present the first empirical study of optimizing a model for Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CUR) based on implicit feedback inferred from user interactions. We show that ranking models for CUR with acceptable performance can be learned in an online setting, although ranking features are noisy because of the language mismatch.

AB To me, an awareness of history is a fundamental requirement for progress; and I believe that we in the field of information retrieval are currently ill-served in this domain, or at least not as aware as we should be. While it is true that a researcher in IR is expected to acquire some knowledge of what has gone before, this knowledge is typically fairly narrow in scope. There are some IR researchers who regard IR as a branch of computer science, for example, despite the fact that the field has a long and venerable history entirely outside the domain of computers, as well as a considerable current presence in academic departments well away from CSDs. Outside of our immediate community, there is a widespread belief that web search engines arose out of nothing, a totally new invention for the totally new world of the web.

AB In information retrieval and information visualization, hierarchies are a common tool to structure information into topics or facets, and network visualizations such as knowledge graphs link related concepts within a domain. In this paper, we explore a multi-layer extension to knowledge graphs, hierarchical knowledge graphs (HKGs), that combines hierarchical and network visualizations into a unified data representation. Through interaction logs, we show that HKGs preserve the benefits of single-layer knowledge graphs at conveying domain knowledge while incorporating the sense making advantages of hierarchies for knowledge seeking tasks. Specially, this paper describes our algorithm to construct these visualizations, analyzes interaction logs to quantitatively demonstrate performance parity with networks and performance advantages over hierarchies, and synthesizes data from interaction logs, interviews, and thinkalouds on a testbed data set to demonstrate the utility of the unified hierarchy+network structure in our HKGs.

AB In this paper we introduce a new data set consisting of user comments posted to the website of a German-language Austrian newspaper. Professional forum moderators have annotated 11,773 posts according to seven categories they considered crucial for the efficient moderation of online discussions in the context of news articles. In addition to this taxonomy and annotated posts, the data set contains one million unlabeled posts. Our experimental results using six methods establish a first baseline for predicting these categories. The data and our code are available for research purposes from https://ofai.github.io/million-post- corpus.

DE Online metrics; online evaluation; A/B testing
AB Online search evaluation, and A/B testing in particular, is an irreplaceable tool for modern search engines. Typically, online experiments last for several days or weeks and require a considerable portion of the search traffic. Despite the increasing need for running more experiments, the amount of that traffic is limited. This situation leads to the problem of finding new key performance metrics with higher sensitivity and lower variance. Recently, we proposed a number of techniques to alleviate this need for larger sample sizes in A/B experiments.
   One approach was based on formulating the quest for finding a sensitive metric as a data-driven machine learning problem of finding a sensitive metric combination [2]. We assumed that each single observation in these experiments is assigned with a vector of metrics (features) describing it. After that, we learned a linear combination of these metrics, such that the learned combination can be considered as a metric itself, and (a) agrees with the preference direction in the seed experiments according to a baseline ground truth metric, (b) achieves a higher sensitivity than the baseline ground-truth metric.
   Another approach addressed the problem of delays in the treatment effects causing low sensitivity of the metrics and requiring to conduct A/B experiments with longer duration or larger set of users from a limited traffic [1]. We found that a delayed treatment effect of a metric could be revealed through the daily time series of the metricaAZs measurements over the days of an A/B test. So, we proposed several metrics that learn the models of the trend in such time series and use them to quantify the changes in the user behavior.
   Finally, in another study [3], we addressed the problem of variance reduction for user engagement metrics and developed a general framework that allows us to incorporate both the existing state-of-the-art approaches to reduce the variance and some novel ones based on advanced machine learning techniques. The expected value of the key metric for a given user consists of two components: (1) the expected value for this user irrespectively the treatment assignment and (2) the treatment effect for this user. The expectation of the 1st component does not depend on the treatment assignment and does not contribute to the actual average treatment effect, but may increase the variance of its estimation. If we knew the value of the first component, we would subtract it from the key metric and obtain a new metric with decreased variance. However, since we cannot evaluate the first component exactly, we propose to predict it based on the attributes of the user that are independent of the treatment exposure. Therefore, we propose to utilize, instead of the average value of a key metric, its average deviation from its predicted value. In this way, the problem of variance reduction is reduced to the problem of finding the best predictor for the key metric that is not aware of the treatment exposure. In our general approach, we apply gradient boosted decision trees and achieve a significantly greater variance reduction than the state-of-the-art.

DE Influence Maximization; Graph Sparsification; Cross-network; Domain
   Adaptation; Feature Incompatibility; Self-training
AB When tackling large-scale influence maximization (IM) problem, one effective strategy is to employ graph sparsification as a preprocessing step, by removing a fraction of edges to make original networks become more concise and tractable for the task. In this work, a Cross-Network Graph Sparsification (CNGS) model is proposed to leverage the influence backbone knowledge pre detected in a source network to predict and remove the edges least likely to contribute to the influence propagation in the target networks. Experimental results demonstrate that conducting graph sparsification by the proposed CNGS model can obtain a good trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness of IM, i.e., existing IM greedy algorithms can run more efficiently, while the loss of influence spread can be made as small as possible in the sparse target networks.

AB Document expansion has been shown to improve the effectiveness of information retrieval systems by augmenting documents' term probability estimates with those of similar documents, producing higher quality document representations. We propose a method to further improve document models by utilizing external collections as part of the document expansion process. Our approach is based on relevance modeling, a popular form of pseudo-relevance feedback; however, where relevance modeling is concerned with query expansion, we are concerned with document expansion. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model improves ad-hoc document retrieval effectiveness on a variety of corpus types, with a particular benefit on more heterogeneous collections of documents.

DE Broadcasting content; Smart media; Content mining; Scene segmentation;
   Topic model
AB Broadcasting contents are the most plausiable resources for services with video contents. Even though we already have huge amount of produced broadcasting contents, there rarely exists a system to analyze and generate information on broadcasting contents to support content retrieval and recommendation services. This paper proposes a new system for this purpose. In the proposed system, a broadcasting content is segmented into semantic units, scenes, based on its multiple characteristics. The proposed system analyzes scenes and generates their keywords, topics, and stories. Connections among scenes are automatically establishing based on shared keywords, similar topics, and consistency in stories. To support operaters, the proposed system offers two tools: Scene Studio and SceneViz. We prepare several Open APIs in the proposed system to provide information and connections for service providers. The feasibility of the proposed system is shown with numerical evaluations on the qualities of generated information. We also introduce two video clip services implemented with our system.

AB Corporations spend millions of dollars on developing creative image based promotional content to advertise to their user-base on platforms like Twitter. Our paper is an initial study, where we propose a novel method to evaluate and improve outreach of promotional images from corporations on Twitter, based purely on their describable aesthetic attributes. Existing works in aesthetic based image analysis exclusively focus on the attributes of digital photographs, and are not applicable to advertisements due to the influences of inherent content and context based biases on outreach.
   Our paper identifies broad categories of biases affecting such images, describes a method for normalizing outreach scores to eliminate effects of those biases, which enables us to subsequently examine the effects of certain handcrafted describable aesthetic features on image outreach. Optimizing on the features resulting from this research is a simple method for corporations to complement their existing marketing strategy to gain significant improvement in user engagement on social media for promotional images.

DE graph-based SSL; mutual kNN graph; over sparsification problem
AB Graph construction is an important process in graph-based semi supervised learning. Presently, the mutual kNN graph is the most preferred as it reduces hub nodes which can be a cause of failure during the process of label propagation. However, the mutual kNN graph, which is usually very sparse, suffers from over sparsification problem. That is, although the number of edges connecting nodes that have different labels decreases in the mutual kNN graph, the number of edges connecting nodes that have the same labels also reduces. In addition, over sparsification can produce a disconnected graph, which is not desirable for label propagation. So we present a new graph construction method, the centered kNN graph, which not only reduces hub nodes but also avoids the over sparsification problem.

DE Life event; DTMs (Dynamic Topic Models); Information needs
AB We propose a method to clarify the evolution of users' information needs related to a user's interests and actions based upon life events such as "childbirth." First, we extract topic transitions using dynamic topic models from blogs posted by users who have experienced life events. Next, we select the topics by computing the differences in topic probabilities before and after the life event. We evaluated our method based on three life events: "childbirth," "finding employment," and "marriage." Our method selected life event-relevant topics such as "child development," "working life," and "wedding ceremony." We found mothers' information needs such as "how to introduce baby food," employees' information needs such as "preparing an induction programme," and couples' information needs such as "wedding reception planning" in each topic.

AB Information retrieval test collections are typically built using data from large-scale evaluations in international forums such as TREC, CLEF, and NTCIR. Previous validation studies on pool-based test collections for ad hoc retrieval have examined their reusability to accurately assess the effectiveness of systems that did not participate in the original evaluation. To our knowledge, the reusability of test collections derived from "living labs" evaluations, based on logs of user activity, has not been explored. In this paper, we performed a "leave-one-out" analysis of human judgment data derived from the TREC 2016 Real-Time Summarization Track and show that those judgments do not appear to be reusable. While this finding is limited to one specific evaluation, it does call into question the reusability of test collections built from living labs in general, and at the very least suggests the need for additional work in validating such experimental instruments.

DE Distant Supervision; Relation Extraction; Neural Network
AB Distant Supervision is a widely used approach for training relation extraction models. It generates noisy training samples by heuristically labeling a corpus using an existing knowledge base. Previous noise reduction methods for distant supervision fail to utilize information such as data credibility and sample confidence. In this paper, we proposed a novel neural framework, named ENCORE (External Neural COnstraints REgularized distant supervision), which allows an integration of other information for standard DS through regularizations under multiple external neural networks. In ENCORE, a teacher-student co-training mechanism is used to iterative distilling information from external neural networks to an existing relation extraction model. The experiment results demonstrated that without increasing any data or reshaping its original structure, ENCORE enhanced a CNN based relation extraction model for over 12%. The enhanced model also outperforms the state-of-the-art relation extraction method on the same dataset.

DE Search of Nonlinguistic Data; Shogi; Symbol Grounding
AB There are many databases of game records available online. In order to retrieve a game state from such a database, users usually need to specify the target state in a domain-specific language, which may be difficult to learn for novice users. In this work, we propose a search system that allows users to retrieve game states from a game record database by using keywords. In our approach, we first train a neural network model for symbol grounding using a small number of pairs of a game state and a commentary on it. We then apply it to all the states in the database to associate each of them with characteristic terms and their scores. The enhanced database thus enables users to search for a state using keywords. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conducted experiments of game state retrieval using game records of Shogi (Japanese chess) with commentaries. The results demonstrate that our approach gives significantly better results than full-text search and an LSTM language model.

AB Result ranking in commercial web search engines is based on a wide array of signals, from keywords appearing on web pages to behavioral (clickthrough) data aggregated across many users or from the current user only. The recent emergence of wearable devices has enabled the collection of physiological data such as heart rate, skin temperature, and galvanic skin response at a population scale. These data are useful for many public health tasks, but they may also provide novel clues about people's interests and intentions as they engage in online activities. In this paper, we focus on heart rate and show that there are strong relationships between heart rate and various measures of user interest in a search result. We integrate features of heart rate, including heart rate dynamics, as additional attributes in a competitive machine-learned web search ranking algorithm. We show that we can obtain significant relevance improvements from this physiological sensing that vary depending on the search topic.

Therefore, professionals are needed for the implementation and configuration of retrieval systems and retrieval components. Our web-based application, called Xtrieval Web Lab, enables newcomers and learners to gain practical knowledge about the information retrieval process. They can arrange a multitude of components of retrieval systems and evaluate them with real world data without utilizing a programming language. Game mechanics guide the learners in their discovery process and motivate them.

AB In recent years, more and more Chinese people desires to be able to access the large amount of foreign language information and understand what is happening all over the world. However, language barrier is always a problem to them. In order to break the language barrier and connect Chinese people to the foreign language information in the world, Sogou has built a cross lingual information retrieval (CLIR) system named Sogou English (http://english.sogou.com), which enables Chinese people to search and browse foreign language information with Chinese.

DE Web Crawling; URL De-duplication; Sequence-to-Sequence Neural Network
AB Many URLs on the Internet point to identical contents, which increase the burden of web crawlers. Techniques that detect such URLs (known as URL de-duping) can greatly save resources such as bandwidth and storage for crawlers. Traditional de-duping methods are usually limited to heavily engineered rule matching strategies. In this work, we propose a novel URL de-duping framework based on sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) neural networks. A single concise translation model can take the place of thousands of explicit rules. Experiments indicate that a vanilla Seq2Seq architecture yields robust and accurate results in detecting duplicate URLs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficiency of this framework in the real large-scale web environment.

   Formula features
AB With the quick availability and growth of mathematical information worldwide, how to effectively retrieve the relevant information about mathematical formulae, has attracted increasing attention from the researchers of mathematical information retrieval (MIR). Existing methods mainly focus on the appearance similarity between formulae. However, there are more important formula related information that could be explored, for instance, link relations between formulae, formula contexts and temporal information. In this study, I propose a novel formula feature modeling method for mathematical information retrieval. In more details, three new formula features have been proposed for better representing mathematical formulae: formula-related concept features extracted from link structure (Formula Citation Graph, FCG), essential semantic features extracted from descriptive textual information of formulae through Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and temporal features extracted from time-related information. All these features could be used to index and retrieve formulae.

DE Emotion Tagging; Transfer Learning; Neural Networks
AB This paper studies an emotion classification problem, which aims to classify online news comments to one of fine-grained emotion categories, e.g. happy, sad, and angry, etc. Neural networks have been widely used and achieved great success in sentiment classification. However, there must be sufficient labeled comments available for training neural networks, which usually requires labor-intensive and time-consuming manual labeling. One of the most effective solutions is to apply transfer learning, which uses abundant labeled comments from a source news domain to help the classification for another target domain with limited amount of labeled data. Still, the comments from different domains can have very different word distributions, which makes it difficult to transfer knowledge from one domain to another. In this paper, we accomplish cross-domain emotion tagging based on an advanced neural network BLSTM (bidirectional long short-term memory) with "domain translation", which can overcome the difference between domains. A weighted linear transformation is utilized to "translate" knowledge from source to target domain. An extensive set of experimental results on four datasets from popular online news services demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed models.

DE influence maximization; coordination game model; social networks; viral
   marketing
AB Influence maximization, the fundamental of viral marketing, aims to find top-K seed nodes maximizing influence spread under certain spreading models. In this paper, we study influence maximization from a game perspective. We propose a Coordination Game model, in which every individuals make their decisions based on the benefit of coordination with their network neighbors, to study information propagation. Our model serves as the generalization of some existing models, such as Majority Vote model and Linear Threshold model. Under the generalized model, we study the hardness of influence maximization and the approximation guarantee of the greedy algorithm. We also combine several strategies to accelerate the algorithm. Experimental results show that after the acceleration, our algorithm significantly outperforms other heuristics, and it is three orders of magnitude faster than the original greedy method.

AB We present the innovative visual analytics approach of the VATE(2) system, which eases and makes more effective the experimental evaluation process by introducing the what-if analysis. The what-if analysis is aimed at estimating the possible effects of a modification to an IR system to select the most promising fixes before implementing them, thus saving a considerable amount of effort.
   VATE(2) builds on an analytical framework which models the behavior of the systems in order to make estimations, and integrates this analytical framework into a visual part which, via proper interaction and animations, receives input and provides feedback to the user.

DE Text Interestingness; Topical Diversity; Political Documents
AB Political texts are pervasive on the Web covering laws and policies in national and supranational jurisdictions. Access to this data is crucial for government transparency and accountability to the population. The main aim of our research is developing a ranking method for political documents which captures the interesting content within political documents. Text interestingness is a measure of assessing the quality of documents from users' perspective which shows their willingness to read a document. Different approaches are proposed for measuring the interestingness of texts. In this research we focus on measuring political texts' interestingness. As political data sources, we use publicly available parliamentary proceedings.

AB Commercial image serving systems, such as Flickr and Facebook, rely on large image caches to avoid the retrieval of requested images from the costly backend image store, as much as possible. Such systems serve the same image in different resolutions and, thus, in different sizes to different clients, depending on the properties of the clients' devices. The requested resolutions of images can be cached individually, as in the traditional caches, reducing the backend workload. However, a potentially better approach is to store relatively high-resolution images in the cache and resize them during the retrieval to obtain lower-resolution images. Having this kind of on-the-fly image resizing capability enables image serving systems to deploy more sophisticated caching policies and improve their serving performance further.
   In this paper, we formalize the static caching problem in image serving systems which provide on-the-fly image resizing functionality in their edge caches or regional caches. We propose two gain-based caching policies that construct a static, fixed-capacity cache to reduce the average serving time of images. The basic idea in the proposed policies is to identify the best resolution(s) of images to be cached so that the average serving time for future image retrieval requests is reduced. We conduct extensive experiments using real-life data access logs obtained from Flickr. We show that one of the proposed caching policies reduces the average response time of the service by up to 4.2% with respect to the best-performing baseline that mainly relies on the access frequency information to make the caching decisions. This improvement implies about 25% reduction in cache size under similar serving time constraints.

AB Why do people start a search? Why do they stop? Why do they do what they do in-between? Our goal in this paper is to provide a simple yet general explanation for these acts that has its basis in neuropsychology and observed user behavior. We coin the term "ingram", as an information counterpart to Richard Semon's "engram" or "memory trace". People search to create ingrams. People stop searching because they have created sufficient ingrams, or given up. We describe these acts through a pair of user models and use it to explain various user behaviors in search activity. Understanding people's search acts in terms of ingrams may help us predict or model the interaction of people's information needs, the queries they issue, and the information they consume. If we could observe certain decision-making acts within these activities, we might also gain new insight into the relationships between textual information and knowledge representation.

DE Search behavior; interactive information retrieval; user interfaces;
   slow search
AB This research explores the notion of slow search, where retrieval speed may be traded for improvements in result quality. This time-quality tradeoff leads to a number of implications for user interface and algorithm design. We will explore this space along various dimensions, including behavioral and qualitative analyses of interaction to investigate the value a user that is able to perceive when given the option to use slow search in addition to traditional search. We will also examine how different notions of 'quality' that a system might optimize may fit into this framework.

DE Test Collection; User Behavior; Review Sites
AB Online review sites are widely used for various domains including movies and restaurants. These sites now have strong influences towards users during purchasing processes. There exist plenty of research works for review sites on various aspects, including item recommendation, user behavior analysis, etc. However, due to the lack of complete and comprehensive dataset, there are still problems that remain to be solved. Therefore, in this paper we assemble and publish such dataset (CCMR) for the community. CCMR outruns existing datasets in terms of completeness, comprehensiveness and scale. Besides describing the dataset and its collecting methodology, we also propose several potential research topics that are made possible by having this dataset. Such topics include: (i) a statistical approach to reduce the impacts from fake reviews and (ii) analyzing and modeling the influences of public opinions towards users during rating actions. We further conduct preliminary analysis and experiments for both directions to show that they are promising.

DE Event Validation; Event Detection; Evaluation; Corpus Construction
AB Manually inspecting text in a document collection to assess whether an event occurs in it is a cumbersome task. Although a manual inspection can allow one to identify and discard false events, it becomes infeasible with increasing numbers of automatically detected events. In this paper, we present a system to automatize event validation, defined as the task of determining whether a given event occurs in a given document or corpus. In addition to supporting users seeking for information that corroborates a given event, event validation can also boost the precision of automatically detected event sets by discarding false events and preserving the true ones. The system allows to specify events, retrieves candidate web documents, and assesses whether events occur in them. The validation results are shown to the user, who can revise the decision of the system. The validation method relies on a supervised model to predict the occurrence of events in a non-annotated corpus. This system can also be used to build ground-truths for event corpora.

   linkage; Social networks
AB Many organizations possess social media accounts on different social networks, but these profiles are not always linked. End applications, users, as well as the organization themselves, can benefit when the profiles are appropriately identified and linked. Most existing works on social network entity linking focus on linking individuals, and do not model features specific for organizational linking. We address this gap not only to link official social media accounts but also to discover and solve the identification and linking of associated affiliate accounts - such as geographical divisions and brands - which are important to distinguish.
   We instantiate our method for classifying profiles on social network services for Twitter and Facebook, which major organizations use. We classify profiles as to whether they belong to an organization or its affiliates. Our best classifier achieves an accuracy of 0.976 on average in both datasets, significantly improving baselines that exploit the features used in state-of-the-art comparable user linkage strategies.

DE Information seeking behavior; geographical exploration; exploratory
   behavior
AB People have their behavioral patterns, through which they determine how to seek and use information. People also exhibit established mobility pattern in their everyday lives. Meanwhile, the modern technologies such as smartphones, wearable devices, and eye trackers have allowed researchers to collect personal, contextual, and cognitive information of users, and create behavioral models from different perspectives. Considering the analogy between information exploration and geographical exploration, I want to identify the interconnections between these behaviors and predict individuals' search behavior using personal and contextual signals. The proposal uses a mixed-method approach that involves a four-week field study, a game study, and a lab study, collecting data from 40 participants through mobile device, eye tracker, online logs, and weekly diary.

AB Web search engines often retrieve answers for queries about popular entities from a growing knowledge base that is populated by a continuous information extraction process. However, less popular entities are not frequently mentioned on the web and are generally interesting to fewer users; these entities reside on the long tail of information. Traditional knowledge base construction techniques that rely on the high frequency of entity mentions to extract accurate facts about these mentions have little success with entities that have low textual support.
   We present LONLIES, a system for estimating property values of long tail entities by leveraging their relationships to head topics and entities. We demonstrate (1) how LONLIES builds communities of entities that are relevant to a long tail entity utilizing a text corpus and a knowledge base; (2) how LONLIES determines which communities to use in the estimation process; (3) how we aggregate estimates from community entities to produce final estimates, and (4) how users interact with LONLIES to provide feedback to improve the final estimation results.

DE Microblog Retrieval; Code Mixing; Retrievability; Fusion
AB Mixing multiple languages within the same document, a phenomenon called (linguistic) code mixing or code switching, is a frequent trend among multilingual users of social media. In the context of information retrieval (IR), code mixing may affect retrieval effectiveness due to the mixing of different vocabularies with different collection statistics within a single collection of documents. In this paper, we investigate the indexing and retrieval strategies for a mixed collection of documents, comprising of code-mixed and the monolingual documents. In particular, we address three alternative modes of indexing, namely (a) a single index for the two sub-collections; (b) a separate index for each sub-collection; and (c) a clustered index with two individual sub-collection statistics coupled with the overall one. We make use of the expected retrievability scores of the two classes of documents to empirically show that indexing strategies (a) and (b) mostly retrieve the monolingual documents at top ranks with standard retrieval approaches. Our experiments show that, by contrast, the clustered index (c) is able to alleviate this problem by improving the retrievability of the code-mixed documents.

AB Succinct data structures are used today in many information retrieval applications, e.g., posting lists representation, language model representation, indexing (social) graphs, query auto-completion, document retrieval and indexing dictionary of strings, just to mention the most recent ones. These new kind of data structures mimic the operations of their classical counterparts within a comparable time complexity but require much less space. With the availability of several libraries for basic succinct structures - like SDSL, Succinct, Facebook's Folly, and Sux - it is relatively easy to directly profit from advances in this field.
   In this tutorial we will introduce this field of research by presenting the most important succinct data structures to represent set of integers, set of points, trees, graphs and strings together with their most important applications to Information Retrieval problems. The introduction of the succinct data structures will be sustained with a practical session with programming handouts to solve. This will allow the attendees to directly experiment with implementations of these solutions on real datasets and understand the potential benefits they can bring on their own projects.

AB Wikipedia articles representing an entity or a topic in different language editions evolve independently within the scope of the language-specific user communities. This can lead to different points of views reflected in the articles, as well as complementary and inconsistent information. An analysis of how the information is propagated across the Wikipedia language editions can provide important insights in the article evolution along the temporal and cultural dimensions and support quality control. To facilitate such analysis, we present MultiWiki - a novel web-based user interface that provides an overview of the similarities and differences across the article pairs originating from different language editions on a timeline. MultiWiki enables users to observe the changes in the interlingual article similarity over time and to perform a detailed visual comparison of the article snapshots at a particular time point.

DE Eyeglasses Recommendation; Probabilistic Graphical Model
AB We demonstrate iGlasses, a novel recommendation system that accepts a frontal face photo as the input and returns the best-fit eyeglasses as the output. As conventional recommendation techniques such as collaborative filtering become inapplicable in the problem, we propose a new recommendation method which exploits the implicit matching rules between human faces and eyeglasses. We first define fine-grained attributes for human faces and frames of glasses respectively. Then, we develop a recommendation framework based on a probabilistic graphical model, which effectively captures the correlation among these fine-grained attributes. Ranking of the frames (glasses) is done by their similarity to the query facial attributes. Finally, we produce a synthesized image for the input face to demonstrate the visual effect when wearing the recommended glasses.

AB Web archives are large longitudinal collections that store webpages from the past, which might be missing on the current live Web. Consequently, temporal search over such collections is essential for finding prominent missing webpages and tasks like historical analysis. However, this has been challenging due to the lack of popularity information and proper ground truth to evaluate temporal retrieval models. In this paper we investigate the applicability of external longitudinal resources to identify important and popular websites in the past and analyze the social bookmarking service Delicious for this purpose.
   The timestamped bookmarks on Delicious provide explicit cues about popular time periods in the past along with relevant descriptors. These are valuable to identify important documents in the past for a given temporal query. Focusing purely on recall, we analyzed more than 12,000 queries and find that using Delicious yields average recall values from 46% up to 100%, when limiting ourselves to the best represented queries in the considered dataset. This constitutes an attractive and low-overhead approach for quick access into Web archives by not dealing with the actual contents.

DE image annotation; subspace clustering; matrix completion; complex errors
AB Annotating images with tags is useful for indexing and retrieving images. However, many available annotation data include missing or inaccurate annotations. In this paper, we propose an image annotation framework which sequentially performs tag completion and refinement. We utilize the subspace property of data via sparse subspace clustering for tag completion. Then we propose a novel matrix completion model for tag refinement, integrating visual correlation, semantic correlation and the novelly studied property of complex errors. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on multiple benchmark datasets even when they contain certain levels of annotation noise.

AB Research on temporal aspects of information retrieval has recently gained considerable interest within the Information Retrieval (IR) community. This paper describes our efforts for building test collections for the purpose of fostering temporal IR research. In particular, we overview the test collections created at the two recent editions of Temporal Information Access (Temporalia) task organized at NTCIR-11 and NTCIR-12, report on selected results and discuss several observations we made during the task design and implementation. Finally, we outline further directions for constructing test collections suitable for temporal IR.

AB The study of temporal dynamics and its impact can be framed within the so-called temporal IR approaches, which explain how user behavior, document content and scale vary with time, and how we can use them in our favor in order to improve retrieval effectiveness.
   This half-day tutorial will outline research issues with respect to temporal dynamics, and provide a comprehensive overview of temporal IR approaches, essentially regarding processing dynamic content, temporal information extraction, temporal query analysis, and time-aware retrieval and ranking. The tutorial is structured into two sessions. During the first session, we will explain the general and wide aspects associated to temporal dynamics by focusing on the web domain, from content and structural changes to variations of user behavior and interactions. We will begin with temporal indexing and query processing. Next step, we will explain current approaches to time-aware retrieval and ranking, which can be classified into different types based on two main notions of relevance with respect to time, namely, recency-based ranking, and time-dependent ranking.
   In the latter session, we will describe research issues centered on determining the temporal intent of queries, and time-aware query enhancement, e.g., temporal relevance feedback, and time-aware query reformulation. In addition, we present applications in related research areas, e.g., exploration, summarization, and clustering of search results, as well as future event retrieval and prediction. To this end, we conclude our tutorial and outline future directions.
   This tutorial targets graduate students, researchers and practitioners in the field of information retrieval. The goal is to provide an overview as well as an important context that enables further research on and practical applications within this area.

AB This full-day tutorial provides general instruction about the design of controlled laboratory experiments that are conducted in order to better understand human information interaction and retrieval. Different data collection methods and procedures are described, with an emphasis on self-report measures and scales. This tutorial also introduces the use of statistical power analysis for sample size estimation and introduces and demonstrate two data analysis procedures, Multilevel Modeling and Structural Equation Modeling, that allow for examination of the whole set of variables present in interactive information retrieval (IIR) experiments, along with their various effect sizes. The goals of the tutorial are (1) to increase participants' understanding of the uses of controlled laboratory experiments with human participants; (2) to increase participants' understanding of the technical vocabulary and procedures associated with such experiments and (2) to increase participants' confidence in conducting and evaluating IIR experiments. Ultimately, we hope our tutorial will increase research capacity and research quality in IR by providing instruction about best practices to those contemplating interactive IR experiments.

DE Context Aware Recommender Systems; Matrix Factorization; Recommender
   Systems; Contextual Feature Selection
AB Recommender Systems(RS) provide more accurate and more relevant recommendations using contextual feature(s). This accuracy improvement is at the cost of computational expenses. Therefore, finding and selecting the most relevant contextual features is an important problem. Moreover, modeling and incorporating the selected contextual features in RS algorithms has an impact on both the accuracy and computational cost. We are conducting a series of studies to detect, define, select, model and incorporate the most relevant contextual features for RS algorithms. The feature detection, definition and selection approach involves the evaluation of features derived from implicit and explicit information. The selected features from this approach can be modeled and incorporated in any selected RS algorithm. In our recent works, we also propose a series of algorithms that incorporates multiple contextual features in the baseline matrix factorization (MF) algorithm. We use the selected contextual features to modify user biases and item biases in the baseline MF.

DE Evaluation; voice search; automatic speech recognition; search engines;
   entity resolution
AB Voice search applications are typically evaluated by comparing the predicted query to a reference human transcript, regardless of the search results returned by the query. While we find that an exact transcript match is highly indicative of user satisfaction, a transcript which does not match the reference still produces satisfactory search results a significant fraction of the time. This paper therefore proposes an evaluation method that compares the search results of the speech recognition hypotheses with the search results produced by a human transcript. Compared with a strict sentence match, a human evaluation shows that search result overlap is a better predictor of (a) user satisfaction and (b) search result click-through. Finally, we propose a model predicting the Expected Search Satisfaction Rate (ESSR), conditioned on search overlap outcomes. On a held out set of 1036 voice search queries, our model predicted an ESSR within 0.9% (relative) of the ground truth satisfaction averaged over 3 human judges.

DE Academic search; expertise retrieval
AB State-of-the-art expert search approaches rely on document-person associations to infer the expertise of a candidate person for a given query. Such associations have traditionally been modeled as boolean variables, indicating whether or not a candidate authored a document, and further normalized to penalize prolific authorships. In this paper, we address expert search in academia, where the authorship of a document can be determined with reasonable certainty. In contrast to traditional approaches, we propose to model associations as non-boolean variables, reflecting the probability that a document is informative of the expertise of a candidate. Moreover, we introduce an alternative normalization scheme that measures how discriminative a particular document-person association is in light of all associations involving either the document or the person. Through a largescale user study with academic experts from several areas of knowledge, we demonstrate the suitability of the proposed association and normalization schemes to improve the effectiveness of a state-of-the-art expert search approach.

AB Similarity functions assign scores to documents in response to queries. These functions require as input statistics about the terms in the queries and documents, where the intention is that the statistics are estimates of the relative informativeness of the terms. Common measures of informativeness use the number of documents containing each term (the document frequency) as a key measure. We argue in this paper that the distribution of within-document frequencies across a collection is also pertinent to informativeness, a measure that has not been considered in prior work: the most informative words tend to be those whose frequency of occurrence has high variance. We propose use of relative standard deviation (RSD) as a measure of variability incorporating within-document frequencies, and show that RSD compares favourably with inverse document frequency (IDF), in both in-principle analysis and in practice in retrieval, with small but consistent gains.

AB Individuals living in highly networked societies publish a large amount of personal, and potentially sensitive, information online. Web investigators can exploit such information for a variety of purposes, such as in background vetting and fraud detection. However, such investigations require a large number of expensive man hours and human effort. This paper describes InfoScout, a search tool which is intended to reduce the time it takes to identify and gather subject centric information on the Web. InfoScout collects relevance feedback information from the investigator in order to re-rank search results, allowing the intended information to be discovered more quickly. Users may still direct their search as they see fit, issuing ad-hoc queries and filtering existing results by keywords. Design choices are informed by prior work and industry collaboration.

AB Stronger engagement and greater participation is often crucial to reach a goal or to solve an issue. Issues like the emerging employee engagement crisis, insufficient knowledge sharing, and chronic procrastination. In many cases we need and search for tools to beat procrastination or to change people's habits. Gamification is the approach to learn from often fun, creative and engaging games. In principle, it is about understanding games and applying game design elements in a non-gaming environments. This offers possibilities for wide area improvements. For example more accurate work, better retention rates and more cost effective solutions by relating motivations for participating as more intrinsic than conventional methods. In the context of Information Retrieval (IR) it is not hard to imagine that many tasks could bene fit from gamification techniques. Besides several manual annotation tasks of data sets for IR research, user participation is important in order to gather implicit or even explicit feedback to feed the algorithms. Gamification, however, comes with its own challenges and its adoption in IR is still in its infancy. Given the enormous response to the first and second GamifIR workshops that were both co-located with ECIR, and the broad range of topics discussed, we now organized the third workshop at SIGIR 2016 to address a range of emerging challenges and opportunities.

AB In this paper we focus on improving the effectiveness of hashing-based approximate nearest neighbour search. Generating similarity preserving hashcodes for images has been shown to be an effective and efficient method for searching through large datasets. Hashcode generation generally involves two steps: bucketing the input feature space with a set of hyperplanes, followed by quantising the projection of the data-points onto the normal vectors to those hyperplanes. This procedure results in the makeup of the hashcodes depending on the positions of the data-points with respect to the hyperplanes in the feature space, allowing a degree of locality to be encoded into the hashcodes. In this paper we study the effect of learning both the hyperplanes and the thresholds as part of the same model. Most previous research either learn the hyperplanes assuming a fixed set of thresholds, or vice-versa. In our experiments over two standard image datasets we find statistically significant increases in retrieval effectiveness versus a host of state-of-the-art data-dependent and independent hashing models.

AB In passage and XML retrieval, contextualisation techniques seek to improve the rank of a relevant element by considering information from its surrounding elements and its container document. Recent research has demonstrated that some of these techniques are also particularly effective in spoken content retrieval tasks (SCR). However, no previous research has directly compared contextualisation techniques in an SCR setting, nor has it studied their potential to provide robustness to speech recognition errors. In this paper, we evaluate different contextualisation techniques, including a recently proposed technique based on positional language models (PLM) on the task of retrieving relevant spoken passages in response to a spoken query. We study the bene fits of these techniques when queries and documents are transcribed with increasingly higher error rates. Experimental results over the Japanese NTCIR SpokenQuery&Doc collection show that combining global and local context is beneficial for SCR and that models usually benefit from using larger amounts of context in highly noisy conditions.

AB In a laboratory study, human assessors were significantly more likely to judge the same documents as relevant when they were presented for assessment within the context of documents selected using random or uncertainty sampling, as compared to relevance sampling. The effect is substantial and significant [0.54 vs. 0.42, p<0.0002] across a population of documents including both relevant and non-relevant documents, for several definitions of ground truth. This result is in accord with Smucker and Jethani's SIGIR 2010 finding that documents were more likely to be judged relevant when assessed within low-precision versus high-precision ranked lists. Our study supports the notion that relevance is malleable, and that one should take care in assuming any labeling to be ground truth, whether for training, tuning, or evaluating text classifiers.

AB We present Sedano, a system for processing and indexing a continuous stream of business-related news. Sedano defines pipelines whose stages analyze and enrich news items (e.g., newspaper articles and press releases). News data coming from several content sources are stored, processed and then indexed in order to be consumed by Atoka, our business intelligence product. Atoka users can retrieve news about specific companies, filtering according to various facets. Sedano features both an entity-linking phase, which finds mentions of companies in news, and a classification phase, which classifies news according to a set of business events. Its flexible architecture allows Sedano to be deployed on commodity machines while being scalable and fault-tolerant.

AB Traditional IR techniques, systems, and methods that assume an individual searcher are often shown to be inadequate for addressing search problems that are multi-faceted and/or too complex or difficult for individuals. The next big leap in information seeking/retrieval could happen by considering social and collaborative aspects of search. In this half-day tutorial, this concept, along with some of the foundational works and latest developments in the field of collaborative information seeking (CIS) will be presented. Specifically, the course will introduce the student to theories, methodologies, and tools that focus on information retrieval/seeking in collaboration. The student will have an opportunity to learn about the social aspect of IR with a focus on collaborative search or CIS situations, systems, and evaluation techniques. The three hours will be divided as: (1) introduction to group-based IR models, approaches, and systems; (2) back-end of CIS systems with system-focused mediation and front-end with user-focused mediation; and (3) evaluation of CIS systems/approaches, prediction and recommendations with collaborative aspects of IR, and future directions. The attendees will be given a course-pack that will include a reference list, an annotated bibliography of seminal works in the field, and depictions of relevant models/frameworks.

AB Social graph construction from various sources has been of interest to researchers due to its application potential and the broad range of technical challenges involved. The World Wide Web provides a huge amount of continuously updated data and information on a wide range of topics created by a variety of content providers, and makes the study of extracted people networks and their temporal evolution valuable for social as well as computer scientists. In this paper we present SocGraph - an extraction and exploration system for social relations from the content of around 2 billion web pages collected by the Internet Archive over the 17 years time period between 1996 and 2013. We describe methods for constructing large social graphs from extracted relations and introduce an interface to study their temporal evolution.

DE Item Exposure; Novelty; Collaborative Filtering
AB The paper proposes a novel approach to appropriately promote those items with few ratings in collaborative filtering. Different from previous works, we force the items with few ratings to be promoted to the users who would potentially be able to give ratings, and then leverage the gathered user preference to punish the promoted items with low quality intrinsically. By slightly sacrificing the benefit of recommending the best items in terms of user satisfaction, our approach seeks to provide all of the items with a chance to be visible equally. The results of the experiments conducted on MovieLens and Netflix data demonstrate its feasibility.

Matches from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 have been curated and made available as a public dataset called Gracenote Music Identification 2014, or GNMID14, at the following address: https://developer.gracenote.com/mid2014. This collection is the first significant music identification dataset and one of the largest music related datasets available containing more than 110M matches in 224 countries for 3M unique tracks, and 509K unique artists. It features geotemporal information (i.e. country and match date), genre and mood metadata. In this paper, we characterize the dataset and demonstrate its utility for Information Retrieval (IR) research.

DE Learning to Rank; IR theory; Consensus Models
AB Relevance labels is the essential part of any learning to rank framework. The rapid development of crowdsourcing platforms led to a significant reduction of the cost of manual labeling. This makes it possible to collect very large sets of labeled documents to train a ranking algorithm. However, relevance labels acquired via crowdsourcing are typically coarse and noisy, so certain consensus models are used to measure the quality of labels and to reduce the noise. This noise is likely to affect a ranker trained on such labels, and, since none of the existing consensus models directly optimizes ranking quality, one has to apply some heuristics to utilize the output of a consensus model in a ranking algorithm, e.g., to use majority voting among workers to get consensus labels.
   The major goal of this paper is to unify existing approaches to consensus modeling and noise reduction within a learning to rank framework. Namely, we present a machine learning algorithm aimed at improving the performance of a ranker trained on a crowdsourced dataset by proper remapping of labels and reweighting of samples. In the experimental part, we use several characteristics of workers/labels extracted via various consensus models in order to learn the remapping and reweighting functions. Our experiments on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that we can significantly improve state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms by incorporating our framework.

AB Primary focus of Information retrieval (IR) systems has been to optimize for Relevance. Existing approaches used to rank documents or evaluate IR systems do not account for "user effort". At present, relevance captures topical overlap between document and user query. This mechanism does not take into consideration either time or effort of end user to satisfy information need. While a judge may spend time assessing a document, an end user may not thoroughly examine a document. We identified factors that are associated with effort for a single document and gathered judgments for same. We also investigated the role of several features in predicting effort on webpage. In future, we shall investigate role of effort on mobile and investigate effort based evaluation methodology that also takes into account user's search task.

AB First Story Detection (FSD) systems aim to identify those news articles that discuss an event that was not reported before. Recent work on FSD has focussed almost exclusively on efficiently detecting documents that are dissimilar from their nearest neighbor. We propose a novel FSD approach that is more effective, by adapting a recently proposed method for news summarization based on 3-nearest neighbor clustering. We show that this approach is more effective than a baseline that uses dissimilarity of an individual document from its nearest neighbor.

AB While location-based social networks (LBSNs) have become widely used for sharing and consuming location information, a large number of users turn to general web search engines for recreational activity ideas. In these cases, users typically express a query combining desired activity type, constraints and suitability, around an explicit location and time - for example, "parks for kids in NYC in winter", or "cheap bars for bachelor party in san francisco". In this work we characterize such queries as recreational queries, and propose a relevance framework for ranking points of interest (POIs) to present in the web search recreational vertical using signals from query logs and LBSNs. The first part of this framework is a taxonomy of recreational intents, which we derive from those previously seen in query logs and other behavioral data. Based on the most popular recreational intents, we proceed to outline a new relevance model combining social, geographical and temporal information. We implement a prototype and conduct a preliminary user-study evaluation. Results show the proposed relevance model and bundles greatly improve user satisfaction for recreational queries.

DE Named entity resolution; Named entity disambiguation
AB Named Entity Disambiguation is the task of disambiguating named entity mentions in unstructured text and linking them to their corresponding entries in a large knowledge base such as Freebase. Practically, each text match in a given document should be mapped to the correct entity out of the corresponding entities in the knowledge base or none of them if no correct entity is found (Empty Entry). The case of an empty entry makes the problem at hand more complex, but by solving it, one can successfully cope with missing and erroneous data as well as unknown entities. In this work we present AOL's Named Entity Resolver which was designed to handle real life scenarios including empty entries. As part of the automated news analysis platform, it processes over 500K news articles a day, entities from each article are extracted and disambiguated. According to our experiments, AOL's resolver shows much better results in disambiguating entities mapped to Wikipedia or Freebase compared to industry leading products.

AB This work takes an in-depth look at the factors that affect manual classifications of "temporally sensitive" information needs. We use qualitative and quantitative techniques to analyze 660 topics from the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) previously used in the experimental evaluation of temporal retrieval models. Regression analysis is used to identify factors in previous manual classifications. We explore potential problems with the previous classifications, considering principles and guidelines for future work on temporal retrieval models.

DE Information Retrieval; Search Engine; Collective Intelligence; Chat
   Channel
AB Traditional information retrieval systems rank documents according to their relevance to users' input queries. State of the art commercial search engines (SEs) train ranking models and suggest query refinements by exploiting collective intelligence implicitly using global users' query logs. However, they do not provide an explicit channel for users to communicate with each other in the search process. By asking or discussing with other users on the fly, a user could find relevant information more conveniently and gain a better search experience. In this paper, we present a demo of novel Search Engine with a live Chat Channel (SECC). SECC can group users automatically based on their input queries and allow them to communicate with each other in real time through a chat interface.

DE Information seeking stopping behavior; eye tracking
AB In this paper, we present a cognitive-economic approach to examining the cost in information search. Unlike previous studies on economic models, we calculated the cost in information search based on participants' eye-tracking data as well as their behavioral data, such as query formulation, search task duration, SERP and web page visits. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we explored a possible latent factor structure of variables representing the cost in information search. Our results indicated that the cost of information seeking could be associated with two distinct aspects of search, exploratory and validation processes.

DE Heterogeneous; Federated search; Aggregated search; Composite retrieval;
   Card recommendation
AB Information access is becoming increasingly heterogeneous. Especially when the user's information need is for exploratory purpose, returning a set of diverse results from different resources could benefit the user. For example, when a user is planning a trip to China, retrieving and showing results from vertical search engines like travel, flight information, map and Q2A sites can satisfy the user's rich and diverse information need. This heterogeneous search paradigm is useful in many contexts and brings many new challenges.

AB Information retrieval researchers and engineers use human computation as a mechanism to produce labeled data sets for product development, research and experimentation. To gather useful results, a successful labeling task relies on many different elements: clear instructions, user interface design, representative high-quality datasets, appropriate inter-rater agreement metrics, work quality checks, and channels for worker feedback. Furthermore, designing and implementing tasks that produce and use several thousands or millions of labels is different than conducting small scale research investigations. In this paper we present a perspective for collecting high quality labels with an emphasis on practical problems and scalability. We focus on three main topics: programming crowds, debugging tasks with low agreement, and algorithms for quality control. We show examples from an industrial setting.

AB Much research in information retrieval (IR) focuses on optimization of the rank of relevant retrieval results for single shot ad hoc IR tasks. Relatively little research has been carried out on user engagement to support more complex search tasks. We seek to improve user engagement for IR tasks by providing richer representation of retrieved information. It is our expectation that this strategy will promote implicit learning within search activities. Specifically, we plan to explore methods of finding semantic concepts within retrieved documents, with the objective of creating improved document surrogates. Further, we would like to study search effectiveness in terms of different facets such as the user's search experience, satisfaction, engagement and learning. We intend to investigate this in an experimental study, where our richer document representations are compared with the traditional document surrogates for the same user queries.

AB We introduce a simple technique to generate incremental query log samples that mimics well the original query distribution. In this way, editorial judgments for new queries can be consistently added to previous judgments. We also review the problem of how to choose the sample size depending on the types of queries that need to be detected as well as the conditions needed to get a good sample.

AB Our goal in this paper is to design cost-aware result caching approaches for meta-search engines. We introduce different levels of eviction, namely, query-, resource- and entry-level, based on the granularity of the entries to be evicted from the cache when it is full. We also propose a novel entry-level caching approach that is tailored for the meta-search scenario and superior to alternative approaches.

AB OCR errors hurt retrieval performance to a great extent. Research has been done on modelling and correction of OCR errors. However, most of the existing systems use language dependent resources or training texts for studying the nature of errors. Not much research has been reported on improving retrieval performance from erroneous text when no training data is available. We propose a novel algorithm for detecting OCR errors and improving retrieval performance on an E-Discovery corpus. Our contribution is two-fold : (1) identifying erroneous variants of query terms for improvement in retrieval performance, and (2) presenting a scope for a possible error-modelling in the erroneous corpus where clean ground truth text is not available for comparison. Our algorithm does not use any training data or any language specific resources like thesaurus. It also does not use any knowledge about the language except that the word delimiter is blank space. The proposed approach obtained statistically significant improvements in recall over state-of-the-art baselines.

The goal of this demo is to give students deeper insight into the consequences of modeling assumptions (BIM vs. BM25) and the consequences of tuning parameter values by means of a two-dimensional representation of probabilities. The application was developed in R, and it is accessible at the following link: http: //gmdn. shinyapps. io/shinyRF04.

DE Text classification; large-scale; context-dependent priors
AB Considerable work in web page classification has focused on incorporating the topical structure of the web (e.g., the hyperlink graph) to improve prediction accuracy. However, the majority of work has primarily focused on relational or graph-based methods that are impractical to run at scale or in an online environment. This raises the question of whether it is possible to leverage the topical structure of the web while incurring nearly no additional prediction-time cost. To this end, we introduce an approach which adjusts a page content-only classification from that obtained with a global prior to the posterior obtained by incorporating a prior which reflects the topic cohesion of the site. Using ODP data, we empirically demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance increases over a range of topics.

AB Large-scale web search engines need to crawl the Web continuously to discover and download newly created web content. The speed at which the new content is discovered and the quality of the discovered content can have a big impact on the coverage and quality of the results provided by the search engine. In this paper, we propose a search-centric solution to the problem of prioritizing the pages in the frontier of a crawler for download. Our approach essentially orders the web pages in the frontier through a random walk model that takes into account the pages' potential impact on user-perceived search quality. In addition, we propose a link graph enrichment technique that extends this solution. Finally, we explore a machine learning approach that combines different frontier prioritization approaches. We conduct experiments using two very large, real-life web datasets to observe various search quality metrics. Comparisons with several baseline techniques indicate that the proposed approaches have the potential to improve the user-perceived quality of web search results considerably.

AB The 2011 Cricket World Cup final match was watched by around 135 million people. Such a huge viewership demands a great experience for users of online cricket portals. Many portals like espncricinfo.com host a variety of content related to recent matches including match reports and ball-by-ball commentaries. When reading a match report, reader experience can be significantly improved by augmenting (on demand) the event mentions in the report with detailed commentaries. We build an event linking system CricketLinking which first identifies event mentions from the reports and then links them to a set of balls. Finding linkable mentions is challenging because unlike entity linking problem settings, we do not have a concrete set of event entities to link to. Further, depending on the event type, event mentions could be linked to a single ball, or to a set of balls. Hence, identifying mention type as well as linking becomes challenging. We use a large number of domain specific features to learn classifiers for mention and mention type detection. Further, we leverage structured match, context similarity and sequential proximity to perform accurate linking Finally, context based summarization is performed to provide a concise briefing of linked balls to each mention.

AB We present an algorithm for identifying users who share a common condition from anonymized search engine logs. Input to the algorithm is a set of seed phrases that identify users with the condition of interest with high precision albeit at a very low recall. We expand the set of seed phrases by clustering queries according to the pages users clicked following these queries and the temporal ordering of queries within sessions, emphasizing the subgraph containing seed phrases. To this end, we extend modularity-based clustering such that it uses the information in the initial seed phrases as well as other queries of users in the population of interest. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two datasets, one of mood disorders and the other of anorexia, by classifying users according to the clusters in which they appeared and the phrases contained thereof, and show that the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) obtained by these methods exceeds 0.87. These results demonstrate the value of our algorithm for both identifying users for future research and to gain better understanding of the language associated with the condition.

ID HYPERGRAPHS; RECOGNITION; INVARIANTS
AB We propose a novel approach for measuring the similarity between weaving patterns that can provide similarity-based search functionality for textile archives. We represent textile structures using hypergraphs and extract multisets of k-neighborhoods from these graphs. The resulting multisets are then compared using Jaccard coefficients, Hamming distances, and cosine measures. We evaluate the different variants of our similarity measure experimentally, showing that it can be implemented efficiently and illustrating its quality using it to cluster and query a data set containing more than a thousand textile samples.

DE IR evaluation; effectiveness measures; binary relevance
AB Many IR effectiveness measures are motivated from intuition, theory, or user studies. In general, most effectiveness measures are well correlated with each other. But, what about where they don't correlate? Which rankings cause measures to disagree? Are these rankings predictable for particular pairs of measures? In this work, we examine how and where metrics disagree, and identify differences that should be considered when selecting metrics for use in evaluating retrieval systems.

DE Foundations of Information Retrieval
AB As we face an explosion of potential new applications for the fundamental concepts and technologies of information retrieval, ranging from ad ranking to social media, from collaborative recommending to question answering systems, many researchers are spending unnecessary time reinventing ideas and relationships that are buried in the prehistory of information retrieval (which, for many researchers, means anything published before they entered graduate school).
   Much of today's received wisdom may be nothing more than the fossilized residue of lively debates concerning such things as. estimation of value and evaluation of systems. Returning to those discussions may open the door to genuinely new insights.
   On the other hand, of the ideas that surface as "new" in today's super-heated research environment have very firm roots in earlier developments in fields as diverse as citation analysis, statistics, and pattern recognition. The purpose of this tutorial is to survey those roots, and their relation to the contemporary fruits on the tree of information retrieval, and to separate, as much as is possible in an era of increasing commercial secrecy about methods, the problems to be solved, the algorithms for solving them, and the heuristics that are the bread and butter of a working operation.
   Among the important new topics whose foundations will be explored are the use of social media in search and advertising, and the growing management of personal image collections for search and for commercial purposes.
   While some might think that an examination of the roots is of merely historical interest, it has practical value as well. When you know which earlier research has provided the origins for the things that you are interested in, you can use that fact to trace its other descendents, and often find rich and rewarding ideas in a literature that you would not normally reach, because it was not considered important by your instructors when you were learning about the problems. In addition to pattern recognition and citation analysis, the tutorial will also expose and review some of the relations to the fields of statistics and operations research.
   Participants will become familiar with roots in Pattern Analysis, Statistics, Information Science and other sources of key ideas that reappear in the current development of Information Retrieval as it applies to Search Engines, Social Media, and Collaborative Systems. They will be able to separate problems from algorithms, and algorithms from heuristics, in the application of these ideas to their own research and/or development activities. Course materials will be made available on a Web site two weeks prior to the tutorial.
   They will include links to relevant software; links to publications that will be discussed; and mechanisms for chat among the tutorial participants, before, during and after the tutorial.
   Specific Topics will include:
   1. The earliest "automated retrieval;
   2. Vectors and Logarithms: their pragmatic origins;
   3. Probabilistic approaches. A frequentist foundation;
   4. The quest for a theoretical foundation;
   5. Generative approaches;
   6. Network approaches;
   7. Binding approaches together.
   Certain materials that are very hard to find, including foundational IBM technical reports by H.P. Luhn and I.J. Good will be scanned and placed on a web site for the tutorial. Since this will not be a public site, we will need some information on advance registration to add participants to the site.

AB There is great imbalance in the richness of information on the web and the succinctness and poverty of search requests of web users, making their queries only a partial description of the underlying complex information needs. Finding ways to better leverage contextual information and make search context-aware holds the promise to dramatically improve the search experience of users. We conducted a series of studies to discover, model and utilize contextual information in order to understand and improve users' searching and browsing behavior on the web. Our results capture important aspects of context under the realistic conditions of different online search services, aiming to ensure that our scientific insights and solutions transfer to the operational settings of real world applications.

DE Music Information Retrieval; Music Recommendation; Content; Context;
   Listener
AB In this tutorial, we give an introduction to the field of and state of the art in music information retrieval (MIR). The tutorial particularly spotlights the question of music similarity, which is an essential aspect in music retrieval and recommendation. Three factors play a central role in MIR research: (1) the music content, i.e., the audio signal itself, (2) the music context, i.e., metadata in the widest sense, and (3) the listeners and their contexts, manifested in user-music interaction traces. We review approaches that extract features from all three data sources and combinations thereof and show how these features can be used for (large-scale) music indexing, music description, music similarity measurement, and recommendation. These methods are further showcased in a number of popular music applications, such as automatic playlist generation and personalized radio stationing, location-aware music recommendation, music search engines, and intelligent browsing interfaces. Additionally, related topics such as music identification, automatic music accompaniment and score following, and search and retrieval in the music production domain are discussed.

DE efficient evaluation; retrieval models; topic models
AB We present a novel approach for efficiently evaluating the performance of retrieval models and introduce two evaluation metrics: Distributional Overlap (DO), which compares the clustering of scores of relevant and non-relevant documents, and Histogram Slope Analysis (HSA), which examines the log of the empirical distributions of relevant and non-relevant documents. Unlike rank evaluation metrics such as mean average precision (MAP) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG), DO and HSA only require calculating model scores of queries and a fixed sample of relevant and non-relevant documents rather than scoring the entire collection, even implicitly by means of an inverted index. In experimental meta-evaluations, we find that HSA achieves high correlation with MAP and NDCG on a monolingual and a cross-language document similarity task; on four ad-hoc web retrieval tasks; and on an analysis of ten TREC tasks from the past ten years. In addition, when evaluating latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) models on document similarity tasks, HSA achieves better correlation with MAP and NCDG than perplexity, an intrinsic metric widely used with topic models.

DE Mobile local search; category; rank distance; cross entropy
AB When searching for place entities such as businesses or points of interest, the desired place may be close (finding the nearest ATM) or far away (finding a hotel in another city). Understanding the role of distance in predicting user interests can guide the design of location search and recommendation systems. We analyze a large dataset of location searches on GPS-enabled mobile devices with 15 location categories. We model user-location distance based on raw geographic distance (kilometers) and intervening opportunities (nth closest). Both models are helpful in predicting user interests, with the intervening opportunity model performing somewhat better. We find significant inter-category variation. For instance, the closest movie theater is selected in 17.7% of cases, while the closest restaurant in only 2.1% of cases. Overall, we recommend taking category information into account when modeling location preferences of users in search and recommendation systems.

DE Interactive Image Retrieval; Information Network; Ranking
AB In some interactive image retrieval systems, users can select images from image search results and click to view their similar or related images until they reach the targets. Existing image ranking options are based on relevance, update time, interestingness and so on. Because the inexact description of user targets or unsatisfying performance of image retrieval methods, it is possible that users cannot reach their targets in single-round interaction. When we consider multi-round interactions, how to assist users to select the images that are easier to reach the targets in fewer rounds is a useful issue. In this paper, we propose a new kind of ranking option to users by ranking the images according to their difficulties of reaching potential targets. We model the interactive image search behavior as navigation on information network constructed by an image collection and an image retrieval method. We use the properties of this information network for reachability based ranking. Experiments based on a social image collection show the efficiency of our approach.

AB We present an approach to extract measured information from text (e.g., a 1370 degrees C melting point, a BMI greater than 29.9 kg/m(2)). Such extractions are critically important across a wide range of domains especially those involving search and exploration of scientific and technical documents. We first propose a rule-based entity extractor to mine measured quantities (i.e., a numeric value paired with a measurement unit), which supports a vast and comprehensive set of both common and obscure measurement units. Our method is highly robust and can correctly recover valid measured quantities even when significant errors are introduced through the process of converting document formats like PDF to plain text. Next, we describe an approach to extracting the properties being measured (e.g., the property pixel pitch in the phrase "a pixel pitch as high as 352 mu m"). Finally, we present MOSEARCH: the realization of a search engine with full support for measured information.

DE Evaluation; Search results clustering; Unbalanced datasets
AB B-CUBED metrics have recently been adopted in the evaluation of clustering results as well as in many other related tasks. However, this family of metrics is not well adapted when datasets are unbalanced. This issue is extremely frequent in Web results, where classes are distributed following a strong unbalanced pattern. In this paper, we present a modified version of B-CUBED metrics to overcome this situation. Results in toy and real datasets indicate that the proposed adaptation correctly considers the particularities of unbalanced cases.

AB Entering Football Players from United States when searching for American Footballers is an example of vocabulary mismatch, which occurs when different words are used to express the same concepts. In order to address this phenomenon for entity search targeting descriptors for complex categories, we propose a compositional-distributional semantics entity search engine, which extracts semantic and commonsense knowledge from large-scale corpora to address the vocabulary gap between query and data.

ID INFORMATION-TRANSFER
AB Searching on the Web or Net-surfing is a part of everyday life for many people, but little is known about the brain activity during Web searching. Such knowledge is essential for better understanding of the cognitive demands imposed by the search system and search tasks. The current study contributes to this understanding by constructing brain networks from EEG data using normalized transfer entropy (NTE) during three Web search task stages: query formulation, viewing of a search result list and reading each individual content page. This study further contributes to the connectivity analysis of the constructed brain networks, since it is an advanced quantitative technique which enables the exploration of brain function by distinct and varied brain areas. By using this approach, we identified that the cognitive activities during the three stages of Web searching are different, with various brain areas becoming more active during the three Web search task stages. Of note, query formulation generated higher interaction between cortical regions than viewing a result list or reading a content page. These findings will have implications for the improvement of Web search engines and search interfaces.

DE Search Metric; Attribute; Filtering; Dynamic Programming
AB Sorting tuples by an attribute value is a common search scenario and many search engines support such capabilities, e.g. price-based sorting in e-commerce, time-based sorting on a job or social media website. However, sorting purely by the attribute value might lead to poor user experience because the relevance is not taken into account. Hence, at the top of the list the users might see irrelevant results. In this paper we choose a different approach. Rather than just returning the entire list of results sorted by the attribute value, additionally we suggest doing the relevance-aware search results (post-)filtering. Following this approach, we develop a new algorithm based on the dynamic programming that directly optimizes a given search quality metric. It can be seamlessly integrated as the final step of a query processing pipeline and provides a theoretical guarantee on optimality. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our algorithm on synthetic data and real learning to rank data sets. Based on the experimental results, we conclude that the proposed algorithm is superior to typically used heuristics and has a clear practical value for the search and related applications.

AB Following news about a specific event can be a difficult task as new information is often scattered across web pages. An up-to-date summary of the event would help to inform users and allow them to navigate to articles that are likely to contain relevant and novel details. We demonstrate an approach that is feasible for online tracking of news that is relevant to a user's ad-hoc query.

DE Cache; Snippet; Solid State Drive
AB In response to a user query, search engines return the top k relevant results, each of which contains a small piece of text, called a snippet, extracted from the corresponding document. Obtaining a snippet is time consuming as it requires both document retrieval (disk access) and string matching (CPU computation), so caching of snippets is used to reduce latency. With the trend of using flash-based solid state drives (SSDs) instead of hard disk drives for search engine storage, the bottleneck of snippet generation shifts from I/O to computation. We propose a simple, but effective method for exploiting this trend, which we call fragment caching: instead of caching the whole snippet, we only cache snippet metadata which describe how to retrieve the snippet from the document. While this approach increases I/O time, the cost is insignificant on SSDs. The major benefit of fragment caching is the ability to cache the same snippets (without loss of quality) while only using a fraction of the memory the traditional method requires. In our experiments, we find around 10 times less memory is required to achieve comparable snippet generation times for dynamic memory, and we consistently achieve a vastly greater hit ratio for static caching.

AB In this demo paper, we introduce a new search engine that supports Information Retrieval (IR) in a dynamic setting. A dynamic search engine distinguishes itself by handling rich interactions and temporal dependency among the queries in a session or for a task. The proposed search engine is called Dumpling, named after the development team's favorite food. It implements state-of-the-art dynamic search algorithms and provides: (i) a dynamic search toolkit by integrating the Query Change Retrieval Model (QCM) and the Win-win search algorithm; (ii) a user-friendly interface supporting side-by-side comparison of search results given by a state-of-the-art static search algorithm and the proposed dynamic search algorithms; (iii) and APIs for developers to apply the dynamic search algorithms to index and search over custom datasets. Dumpling is developed under the umbrella of a bigger project in the DARPA Memex program to crawl and search the dark web to support law enforcement and national security.

AB Majority of the studies on modeling the evolution of a social network using spectral graph kernels do not consider temporal effects while estimating the kernel parameters. As a result, such kernels fail to capture structural properties of the evolution over the time. In this paper, we propose temporal spectral graph kernels of four popular graph kernels namely path counting, triangle closing, exponential and neumann. Their responses in predicting future growth of the network have been investigated in detail, using two large datasets namely Facebook and DBLP. It is evident from various experimental setups that the proposed temporal spectral graph kernels outperform all of their non-temporal counterparts in predicting future growth of the networks.

AB The tremendous increase of multimedia data in recent years has heightened the need for systems that not only allow to search with keywords, but that also support content-based retrieval in order to effectively and efficiently query large collections. In this paper, we introduce ADAM, a system that is able to store and retrieve multimedia objects by seamlessly combining aspects from databases and information retrieval. ADAM is able to work with both structured and unstructured data and to jointly provide Boolean retrieval and similarity search. To efficiently handle large volumes of data it makes use of a signature-based indexing and the distribution of the collection to multiple shards that are queried in a MapReduce style. We present ADAM in the setting of a sketch-based image retrieval application using the ImageNet collection containing 14 million images.

DE Medical information retrieval
AB Medical information is accessible from diverse sources including the general web, social media, journal articles, and hospital records; information searchers can be patients and their families, researchers, practitioners and clinicians. Challenges in medical information retrieval include: diversity of users and user knowledge and expertise; variations in the format, reliability, and quality of biomedical and medical information; the multi-modal nature of much of the data; and the need for accuracy and reliability of medical information. The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested in medical information search with the goal of identifying specific challenges that need to be addressed to advance the state-of-the-art.

DE Information Retrieval; Search Evaluation
AB Recent work introduced a probabilistic framework that measures search engine performance information-theoretically. This allows for novel meta-evaluation measures such as Information Difference, which measures the magnitude of the difference between search engines in their ranking of documents. for which we have relevance information. Using Information Difference we can compare the behavior of search engines-which documents the search engine prefers, as well as search engine performance-how likely the search engine is to satisfy a hypothetical user. In this work, we a) extend this probabilistic framework to precision-oriented contexts, b) show that Information Difference can be used to detect similar search engines at shallow ranks, and c) demonstrate the utility of the Information Difference methodology by showing that well-tuned search engines employing different retrieval models are more similar than a well-tuned and a poorly tuned implementation of the same retrieval model.

DE Analysis of Books; Character Infoboxes; Person disambiguation;
   Person-person network
AB Entities are centric to a large number of real world applications. Wikipedia shows entity infoboxes for a large number of entities. However. not much structured information is available about character entities in books. Automatic discovery of characters from books can help in effective summarization. Such a structured summary which not just introduces characters in the book but also provides a high level relationship between them can be of critical importance for buyers. This task involves the following challenging novel problems: 1. automatic discovery of important characters given a book; 2. automatic social graph construction relating the discovered characters; 3. automatic summarization of text most related to each of the characters; and 4. automatic infobox extraction from such summarized text for each character. As part of this demo, we design mechanisms to address these challenges and experiment with publicly available books.

   interface design
AB It is rare for a new user interface to break through and become successful, especially in information-intensive tasks like search, coming to consensus or building up knowledge. Most complex interfaces end up going unused. Often the successful solution lies in a previously unexplored part of the interface design space that is simple in a new way that works just right.
   In this talk I will give examples of such successes in the information-intensive interface design space, and attempt to provide stimulating ideas for future research directions.

AB The use of sampling, randomized algorithms, or training based on the unpredictable inputs of users in Information Retrieval often leads to non-deterministic outputs. Evaluating the effectiveness of systems incorporating these methods can be challenging since each run may produce different effectiveness scores. Current IR evaluation techniques do not address this problem. Using the context of distributed information retrieval as a case study for our investigation, we propose a solution based on multivariate linear modeling. We show that the approach provides a consistent and reliable method to compare the effectiveness of non-deterministic IR algorithms, and explain how statistics can safely be used to show that two IR algorithms have equivalent effectiveness.

DE Query; term frequency; term occurrence
AB Vocabulary mismatch has long been recognized as one of the major issues affecting search effectiveness. Ineffective queries usually fail to incorporate important terms and/or incorrectly include inappropriate keywords. However, in this paper we show another cause of reduced search performance: sometimes users issue reasonable query terms, but systems cannot identify the correct properties of those terms and take advantages of the properties. Specifically, we study two distinct types of terms that exist in all search queries: (1) necessary terms, for which term occurrence alone is indicative of document relevance; and (2) frequent terms, for which the relative term frequency is indicative of document relevance within the set of documents where the term appears. We evaluate these two properties of query terms in a dataset. Results show that only 1/3 of the terms are both necessary and frequent, while another 1/3 only hold one of the properties and the final third do not hold any of the properties. However, existing retrieval models do not clearly distinguish terms with the two properties and consider them differently. We further show the great potential of improving retrieval models by treating terms with distinct properties differently.

DE Image Retrieval; Random Subspace; Binary Codes; Hamming ranking
AB Due to the fast query speed and low storage cost, hashing based approximate nearest neighbor search methods have attracted much attention recently. Many state of the art methods are based on eigenvalue decomposition. In these approaches, the information caught in different dimensions is unbalanced and generally most of the information is contained in the top eigenvectors. We demonstrate that this leads to an unexpected phenomenon that longer hashing code does not necessarily yield better performance. In this work, we introduce a random subspace strategy to address this limitation. At first, a small fraction of the whole feature space is randomly sampled to train the hashing algorithms each time and only the top eigenvectors are kept to generate one piece of short code. This process will be repeated several times and then the obtained many pieces of short codes are concatenated into one piece of long code. Theoretical analysis and experiments on two benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for hashing.

DE user frustration; classifier; search results ranking; searcher behavior
AB One of the main targets of any search engine is to make every user fully satisfied with her search results. For this reason, lots of efforts are being paid to improving ranking models in order to show the best results to users. However, there is a class of documents on the Web, which can spoil all efforts being shown to the users. When users receive results, which are not only irrelevant, but also completely out of the picture of their expectations, they can get really frustrated. So, we attempted to find a method to determine such documents and reduce their negative impact upon users and, as a consequence, on search engines in general.

DE Twitter; Wikipedia; Photo tag recommendation
AB With the rise in popularity of smart phones, taking and sharing photographs has never been more openly accessible. Further, photo sharing websites, such as Flickr, have made the distribution of photographs easy, resulting in an increase of visual content uploaded online. Due to the laborious nature of annotating images, however, a large percentage of these images are unannotated making their organisation and retrieval difficult. Therefore, there has been a recent research focus on the automatic and semi-automatic process of annotating these images. Despite the progress made in this field, however, annotating images automatically based on their visual appearance often results in unsatisfactory suggestions and as a result these models have not been adopted in photo sharing websites. Many methods have therefore looked to exploit new sources of evidence for annotation purposes, such as image context for example. In this demonstration, we instead explore the scenario of annotating images taken at a large scale events where evidences can be extracted from a wealth of online textual resources. Specifically, we present a novel tag recommendation system for images taken at a popular music festival which allows the user to select relevant tags from related Tweets and Wikipedia content, thus reducing the workload involved in the annotation process.

   media
AB Location models built on social media have been shown to be an important step toward understanding places in queries. Current search technology focuses on predicting broad regions such as cities. Hyperlocal scenarios are important because of the increasing prevalence of smartphones and mobile search and recommendation. Users expect the system to recognize their location and provide information about their immediate surroundings.
   In this work we propose an algorithm for constructing hyperlocal models of places that are as small as half a city block. We show that Dynamic Location Models (DLMs) are computationally efficient, and provide better estimates of the language models of hyperlocal places than the standard method of segmenting the globe into approximately equal grid squares. We evaluate the models using a repository of 25 million geotagged public images from Flickr. We show that the indexes produced by DLMs have a larger vocabulary, and smaller average document length than their fixed grid counterparts, for indexes with an equivalent number of locations. This produces location models that are more robust to retrieval parameters, and more accurate in predicting locations in text.

AB Identifying and targeting visitors on an e-commerce website with personalized content in real-time is extremely important to marketers. Although such targeting exists today, it is based on demographic attributes of the visitors. We show that dynamic visitor attributes extracted from their clickstream provide much better predictive capabilities of visitor intent. In this demonstration, we showcase an interactive real-time user interface for marketers to visualize and target visitor segments. Our dashboard not only provides the marketers understanding of their visitor click patterns, but also lets them target individual or group of visitors with offers and promotions.

This demonstration paper presents a system that allows users to specify at query time a perspective together with their query. The system then presents results from well-known search engines with a visualization of the results which allows the users to quickly surmise the presence of the perspective in the returned set.

AB We address the core challenge of the entity retrieval task: ranking entities in response to a query by their presumed relevance to the information need that the query represents. As an initial research direction we explored two models for entity ranking that were evaluated using the INEX entity ranking dataset and which posted promising performance. A natural future direction to explore is how to generalize these models to address various types of information needs that are associated with entities.
