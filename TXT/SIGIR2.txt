DE food image recognition; social media streaming; deep neural network
AB An increasing number of people share their thoughts and the images of their lives on social media platforms. People are exposed to food in their everyday lives and share on-line what they are eating by means of photos taken to their dishes. The hashtag #foodporn is constantly among the popular hashtags in Twitter and food photos are the second most popular subject in Instagram after selfies. The system that we propose, WORLDFOODMAP, captures the stream of food photos from social media and, thanks to a CNN food image classifier, identifies the categories of food that people are sharing. By collecting food images from the Twitter stream and associating food category and location to them, WORLDFOODMAP permits to investigate and interactively visualize the popularity and trends of the shared food all over the world.

DE Semantic hashing; Variational autoencoder; Deep learning
AB As the amount of textual data has been rapidly increasing over the past decade, efficient similarity search methods have become a crucial component of large-scale information retrieval systems. A popular strategy is to represent original data samples by compact binary codes through hashing. A spectrum of machine learning methods have been utilized, but they often lack expressiveness and flexibility in modeling to learn effective representations. The recent advances of deep learning in a wide range of applications has demonstrated its capability to learn robust and powerful feature representations for complex data. Especially, deep generative models naturally combine the expressiveness of probabilistic generative models with the high capacity of deep neural networks, which is very suitable for text modeling. However, little work has leveraged the recent progress in deep learning for text hashing. In this paper, we propose a series of novel deep document generative models for text hashing. The first proposed model is unsupervised while the second one is supervised by utilizing document labels/tags for hashing. The third model further considers document-specific factors that affect the generation of words. The probabilistic generative formulation of the proposed models provides a principled framework for model extension, uncertainty estimation, simulation, and interpretability. Based on variational inference and reparameterization, the proposed models can be interpreted as encoder-decoder deep neural networks and thus they are capable of learning complex nonlinear distributed representations of the original documents. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on four public testbeds. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed supervised learning models for text hashing.

DE Event recommendation; cold-start problem; graph-based random walking;
   event-based social networks
AB Event recommendation has become an important issue in event-based social networks (EBSN). In this paper, we study how to exploit diverse relations in an EBSN as well as individual history preferences to recommend preferred events. We first construct a hybrid graph consisting of different types of nodes to represent available entities in an EBSN. The graph uses explicit relations as edges to connect nodes of different types; while transferring implicit relations of event attributes to interconnect the event nodes. After executing the graph random walking, we obtain the candidate events with high convergency probabilities. We next extract a user preference from his attended events to further compute his interest similarities to his candidate events. The recommended event list is then obtained by combining the two similarity scores. Data sets from a real EBSN are used to examine the proposed scheme, and experiment results validate its superiority over peer schemes.

DE evaluation metric; mobile search; user behavior
ID WEB SEARCH
AB Mobile search engine result pages (SERPs) are becoming highly visual and heterogenous. Unlike the traditional ten-blue-link SERPs for desktop search, different verticals and cards occupy different amounts of space within the small screen. Hence, traditional retrieval measures that regard the SERP as a ranked list of homogeneous items are not adequate for evaluating the overall quality of mobile SERPs. Specifically, we address the following new problems in mobile search evaluation: (1) Different retrieved items have different heights within the scrollable SERP, unlike a ten-blue-link SERP in which results have similar heights with each other. Therefore, the traditional rank-based decaying functions are not adequate for mobile search metrics. (2) For some types of verticals and cards, the information that the user seeks is already embedded in the snippet, which makes clicking on those items to access the landing page unnecessary. (3) For some results with complex sub-components (and usually a large height), the total gain of the results cannot be obtained if users only read part of their contents. The benefit brought by the result is affected by user's reading behavior and the internal gain distribution (over the height) should be modeled to get a more accurate estimation. To tackle these problems, we conduct a lab-based user study to construct suitable user behavior model for mobile search evaluation. From the results, we find that the geometric heights of user's browsing trails can be adopted as a good signal of user effort. Based on these findings, we propose a new evaluation metric, Height-Biased Gain, which is calculated by summing up the product of gain distribution and discount factors that are both modeled in terms of result height. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed metric, we compare the agreement of evaluation metrics with side-by-side user preferences on a test collection composed of four mobile search engines. Experimental results show that HBG agrees with user preferences 85.33% of the time, which is better than all existing metrics.

AB QUery processing is one of the main bottlenecks in large-scale search engines. Retrieving the top k most relevant documents for a given query can be extremely expensive, as it involves scoring large amounts of documents. Several dynamic pruning techniques have been introduced in the literature to tackle this problem, such as BlockMaxWAND, which splits the inverted index into constant-sized blocks and stores the maximum document-term scores per block; this information can be used during query execution to safely skip low-score documents, producing many-fold speedups over exhaustive methods.
   We introduce a refinement for BlockMaxWANDthat uses variable-sized blocks, rather than constant-sized. We set up the problem of deciding the block partitioning as an optimization problem which maximizes how accurately the block upper bounds represent the underlying scores, and describe an effcient algorithm to find an approximate solution, with provable approximation guarantees. Through an extensive experimental analysis we show that our method significantly outperforms the state of the art roughly by a factor 2 x. We also introduce a compressed data structure to represent the additional block information, providing a compression ratio of roughly 50%, while incurring only a small speed degradation, no more than 10% with respect to its uncompressed counterpart.

DE ad hoc retrieval; game theory; ranking competition
ID PRINCIPLE
AB In competitive search settings as the Web, there is an ongoing ranking competition between document authors (publishers) for certain queries. The goal is to have documents highly ranked, and the means is document manipulation applied in response to rankings. Existing retrieval models, and their theoretical underpinnings (e.g., the probability ranking principle), do not account for post-ranking corpus dynamics driven by this strategic behavior of publishers. However, the dynamics has major effect on retrieval effectiveness since it affects content availability in the corpus. Furthermore, while manipulation strategies observed over the Web were reported in past literature, they were not analyzed as ongoing, and changing, post-ranking response strategies, nor were they connected to the foundations of classical ad hoc retrieval models (e.g., content-based document-query surface level similarities and document relevance priors). We present a novel theoretical and empirical analysis of the strategic behavior of publishers using these foundations. Empirical analysis of controlled ranking competitions that we organized reveals a key strategy of publishers: making their documents (gradually) become similar to documents ranked the highest in previous rankings. Our theoretical analysis of the ranking competition as a repeated game, and its minmax regret equilibrium, yields a result that supports the merits of this publishing strategy. We further show that it can be predicted with high accuracy, and without explicit knowledge of the ranking function, whether documents will be promoted to the highest rank in our competitions. The prediction utilizes very few features which quantify changes of documents, specifically with respect to those previously ranked the highest.

DE Response ranking; next utterance suggestion; neural networks; joint
   learning; conversation system
AB Conversation systems are of growing importance since they enable an easy interaction interface between humans and computers: using natural languages. To build a conversation system with adequate intelligence is challenging, and requires abundant resources including an acquisition of big data and interdisciplinary techniques, such as information retrieval and natural language processing. Along with the prosperity of Web 2.0, the massive data available greatly facilitate data-driven methods such as deep learning for human-computer conversation systems. Owing to the diversity of Web resources, a retrieval-based conversation system will come up with at least some results from the immense repository for any user inputs. Given a human issued message, i.e., query, a traditional conversation system would provide a response after adequate training and learning of how to respond. In this paper, we propose a new task for conversation systems: joint learning of response ranking featured with next utterance suggestion. We assume that the new conversation mode is more proactive and keeps user engaging. We examine the assumption in experiments. Besides, to address the joint learning task, we propose a novel Dual-LSTM Chain Model to couple response ranking and next utterance suggestion simultaneously. From the experimental results, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed task and the effectiveness of the proposed model.

DE social networks; communities; information diffusion
AB Recently, online social networks are becoming increasingly popular platforms for social interactions. Understanding how information propagates in such networks is important for personalization and recommendation in social search. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchicalvel Ittfor'nation Diffusion (FICID) model to capture the informal'.ou diffusion process in social networks. We introduce the notion of users' topic popularity as to enable our model to depict the information diffusion process which is both topic-aware (which topic the information is concerned with) and source-aware (where the information conies from). Instead of assuming homogeneity of social communities, we propose the notion of community hierarchy, where itiformation diffusion across inter-level communities is uni-directional from the higher levels to the lower ones. We design a Gibbs sampling algorithm to infer model parameters and propose prediction methods for two intOnnation diffusion prediction tasks, the re tweet prediction and the cascade prediction. Comparison experiments are conducted on two real datasets. Results show that our model achieves substantial improvement compared with the existing work.

AB Information Retrieval (IR) research has traditionally focused on serving the best results for a single query so-called ad hoc retrieval. However, users typically search iteratively, refining and reformulating their queries during a session. A key challenge in the study of this interaction is the creation of suitable evaluation resources to assess the effectiveness of IR systems over sessions. This paper describes the TREC Session Track, which ran from 2010 through to 2014, which focussed on forming test collections that included various forms of implicit feedback. We describe the test collections; a brief analysis of the differences between datasets over the years; and the evaluation results that demonstrate that the use of user session data significantly improved effectiveness.

DE Topic Model; Semantic Music Retrieval; Personalized
AB In this paper, we study the problem of personalized text-based music retrieval which takes users' music preferences on songs into account via the analysis of online listening behaviours and social tags. Towards the goal, a novel Dual-Layer Music Preference Topic Model (DL-MPTM) is proposed to construct latent music interest space and characterize the correlations among (user, song, term). Based on the DL-MPTM, we further develop an effective personalized music retrieval system. To evaluate the system's performance, extensive experimental studies have been conducted over two test collections to compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art music retrieval methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms those approaches in terms of personalized search accuracy.

DE sentiment dynamics; sentiment change; time series analysis
AB In recent years social media have emerged as popular platforms for people to share their thoughts and opinions on all kind of topics. Tracking opinion over time is a powerful tool that can be used for sentiment prediction or to detect the possible reasons of a sentiment change. Understanding topic and sentiment evolution allows enterprises or government to capture negative sentiment and act promptly. In this study, we explore conventional time series analysis methods and their applicability on topic and sentiment trend analysis. We use data collected from Twitter that span over nine months. Finally, we study the usability of outliers detection and different measures such as sentiment velocity and acceleration on the task of sentiment tracking.

DE Review Rating Prediction; Skip-thought Vectors; Aspect Rating; Data
   Missing
AB Review rating prediction is of much importance for sentiment analysis and business intelligence. Existing methods work well when aspect-opinion pairs can be accurately extracted from review texts and aspect ratings are complete. The challenges of improving prediction accuracy are how to capture the semantics of review content and how to fill in the missing values of aspect ratings. In this paper, we propose a novel review rating prediction method, which improves the prediction accuracy by capturing deep semantics of review content and alleviating data missing problem of aspect ratings. The method firstly learns the latent vector representation of review content using skip-thought vectors, a state-of-the-art deep learning method, then, the missing values of aspect ratings are filled in based on users' history reviewing behaviors, finally, a novel optimization framework is proposed to predict the review rating. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

DE Learning to Rank; Counterfactual Estimation; Causal Inference; Batch
   Learning from Bandit Feedback
AB Online metrics measured through A/B tests have become the gold standard for many evaluation questions. But can we get the same results as A/B tests without actually fielding a new system? And can we train systems to optimize online metrics without subjecting users to an online learning algorithm? This tutorial summarizes and unifies the emerging body of methods on counterfactual evaluation and learning. These counterfactual techniques provide a well-founded way to evaluate and optimize online metrics by exploiting logs of past user interactions. In particular, the tutorial unifies the causal inference, information retrieval, and machine learning view of this problem, providing the basis for future research in this emerging area of great potential impact.

DE IR evaluation; explicit user feedback; web search
AB Gathering evidence about whether a search result is relevant is a core concern in the evaluation and improvement of information retrieval systems. Two common sources of evidence for establishing relevance are judgements from trained assessors and logs of online user behavior. However, both are limited; it is hard for a trained assessor to know exactly what users want to find, and user behavior only provides an implicit and ambiguous signal. In this paper, we aim to address these limitations by collecting explicit feedback on web search results from users in situ as they search. When users return to the search result page via the browser back button after having clicked on a result, we ask them to provide a binary thumbs up or thumbs down judgment and text feedback. We collect in situ feedback from a large commercial search engine, and compare this feedback with the judgments provided by trained assessors. We find that in situ feedback differs significantly from traditional relevance judgments, and that it suggests a different interpretation of behavior signals, with the dwell time threshold between negative and positive in situ feedback being 87 seconds, longer than the more common heuristic of 30 seconds. Using text feedback from users, we discuss why user feedback may differ from editorial judgments.

AB Simulation and analysis have shown that selective search can reduce the cost of large-scale distributed information retrieval. By partitioning the collection into small topical shards, and then using a resource ranking algorithm to choose a subset of shards to search for each query, fewer postings are evaluated. Here we extend the study of selective search using a fine-grained simulation investigating: selective search efficiency in a parallel query processing environment; the difference in efficiency when term-based and sample-based resource selection algorithms are used; and the effect of two policies for assigning index shards to machines. Results obtained for two large datasets and four large query logs confirm that selective search is significantly more efficient than conventional distributed search. In particular, we show that selective search is capable of both higher throughput and lower latency in a parallel environment than is exhaustive search.

DE public health; ailments; social media; topic models
AB Social media has become a major source for analyzing all aspects of daily life. Thanks to dedicated latent topic analysis methods such as the Ailment Topic Aspect Model (ATAM), public health can now be observed on Twitter. In this work, we are interested in monitoring people's health over time. Recently, Temporal-LDA (TM-LDA) was proposed for efficiently modeling general-purpose topic transitions over time. In this paper, we propose Temporal Ailment Topic Aspect (TM-ATAM), a new latent model dedicated to capturing transitions that involve health-related topics. TM-ATAM learns topic transition parameters by minimizing the prediction error on topic distributions between consecutive posts at different time and geographic granularities. Our experiments on an 8-month corpus of tweets show that it largely outperforms its predecessors.

AB How do we evaluate systems that filter social media streams and send users updates via push notifications on their mobile phones? Such notifications must be relevant, timely, and novel. In this paper, we explore various evaluation metrics for this task, focusing specifically on measuring relevance. We begin with an analysis of metrics deployed at the TREC 2015 Microblog evaluations. A simple change to the metrics, reflecting a different assumption, dramatically alters system rankings. Applying another metric, previously used in the TREC Microblog evaluations, again yields different system rankings. We find little correlation between a number of \reasonable" evaluation metrics, which suggests that system effectiveness depends on how you measure it an undesirable state in IR evaluation. However, we argue that existing evaluation metrics can be generalized into a framework that uses the same underlying contingency table, but places different weights and penalties. Although we stop short of proposing the "one true metric", this framework can guide the future development of a family of metrics that more accurately models user needs.

DE Multi-objective optimization; Learning to rank
AB Offline evaluation of information retrieval systems typically focuses on a single effectiveness measure that models the utility for a typical user. Such a measure usually combines a behavior-based rank discount with a notion of document utility that captures the single relevance criterion of topicality. However, for individual users relevance criteria such as credibility, reputability or readability can strongly impact the utility. Also, for different information needs the utility can be a different mixture of these criteria. Because of the focus on single metrics, offline optimization of IR systems does not account for different preferences in balancing relevance criteria.
   We propose to mitigate this by viewing multiple relevance criteria as objectives and learning a set of rankers that provide different trade-offs w.r.t. these objectives. We model document utility within a gain-based evaluation framework as a weighted combination of relevance criteria. Using the learned set, we are able to make an informed decision based on the values of the rankers and a preference w.r.t. the relevance criteria. On a dataset annotated for readability and a web search dataset annotated for sub-topic relevance we demonstrate how trade-offs between can be made explicit. We show that there are different available trade-offs between relevance criteria.

AB Query logs are valuable resources for Information Retrieval (IR) research. However, because they are also rich in private and personal information, the huge concern of leaking user privacy prevents query logs from being shared from the search companies to the broad research community. Bothered by the lack of good research data for years, the authors of this paper are motivated to explore ways to generate anonymized query logs that can still be effectively used to support the search task. We introduce a framework to anonymize query logs by differential privacy, the latest development in privacy research. The framework is empirically evaluated against multiple search algorithms on their retrieval utility, measured in standard IR evaluation metrics, using the anonymized logs. The experiments show that our framework is able to achieve a good balance between retrieval utility and privacy.

DE Inverted index compression; context-free grammar; query processing
AB Large-scale search engines need to answer thousands of queries per second over billions of documents, which is typically done by querying a large inverted index. Many highly optimized integer encoding techniques are applied to compress the inverted index and reduce the query processing time. In this paper, we propose a new grammar-based inverted index compression scheme, which can improve the performance of both index compression and query processing.
   Our approach identifies patterns (common subsequences of docIDs) among different posting lists and generates a context-free grammar to succinctly represent the inverted index. To further optimize the compression performance, we carefully redesign the index structure. Experiments show a reduction up to 8.8% in space usage while decompression is up to 14% faster.
   We also design an efficient list intersection algorithm which utilizes the proposed grammar-based inverted index. We show that our scheme can be combined with common docID reassignment methods and encoding techniques, and yields about 14% to 27% higher throughput for AND queries by utilizing multiple threads.

DE Recommendation; curiosity; psychology; personalization
AB Traditional recommendation systems (RSs) aim to recommend items that are relevant to the user's interest. Unfortunately, the recommended items will soon become too familiar to the user and hence fail to arouse her interest. Discovery-oriented recommendation systems (DORSs) complement accuracy with discover utilities (DUs) such as novelty and diversity and optimize the tradeoff between the DUs and accuracy of the recommendations. Unfortunately, DORSs ignore an important fact that different users have different appetites for DUs. That is, highly curious users can accept highly novel and diversified recommendations whereas conservative users would behave in the opposite manner. In this paper, we propose a curiosity-based recommendation system (CBRS) framework which generates recommendations with a personalized amount of DUs to fit the user's curiosity level. The major contribution of this paper is a computational model of user curiosity, called Probabilistic Curiosity Model (PCM), which is based on the curiosity arousal theory and Wundt curve in psychology research. In PCM, we model a user's curiosity with a curiosity distribution function learnt from the user's access history and compute a curiousness score for each item representing how curious the user is about the item. CBRS then selects items which are both relevant and have high curiousness score, bounded by the constraint that the amount of DUs fits the user's DU appetite. We use joint optimization and co-factorization approaches to incorporate the curiosity signal into the recommendations. Extensive experiments have been performed to evaluate the performance of CBRS against the baselines using a music dataset from last.fm. The results show that compared to the baselines CBRS not only provides more personalized recommendations that adapt to the user's curiosity level but also improves the recommendation accuracy.

DE online evaluation; search engine switching
AB In this paper we present a novel application of the search engine switching prediction model for online evaluation. We propose a new metric pSwitch for A/B-testing, which allows us to evaluate the quality of search engines in different aspects such as the quality of the user interface and the quality of the ranking function. pSwitch is a search session-level metric, which relies on the predicted probability that the session contains a switch to another search engine and reflects the degree of the failure of the session. We demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of pSwitch using A/B-testing experiments with real users of search engine Yandex. We compare our metric with recently proposed SpU (sessions per user) metric and other widely used query-level A/B metrics, such as Abandonment Rate and Time to First Click, which we used as our baseline metrics. We observed that pSwitch metric is more sensitive in comparison with those baseline metrics and also that pSwitch and SpU are more consistent with ground truth, than Abandonment Rate and Time to First Click.

AB This demonstration presents an infrastructure for computing multilingual semantic relatedness and correlation for twelve natural languages by using three distributional semantic models (DSMs). Our demonsrator- Dlnfra (Distributional Infrastructure) provides researchers and developers with a highly useful platform for processing large-scale corpora and conducting experiments with distributional semantics. We integrate several multilingual DSMs in our webservice so end user can obtain a result without worrying about the complexities involved in building DSMs. Our webservice allows the users to have easy access to a wide range of comparisons of DSMs with different parameters. In addition, users can configure and access DSM parameters using a easy to use API.

AB Colleagues, friends, let me begin by expressing how pleased, and humbly honored I am to be a recipient of the Gerard Salton Award. Gerry was a great man, and to receive the award named for him is very special. For me personally, it is especially meaningful, given the sometime disputatious nature of our professional interactions, and what seemed, on the surface, to be quite different ideas about information retrieval. I say, on the surface, because in the end, I believe that he and I both shared the same goal for the field, although we approached it from quite different positions. In this presentation, I will speak at some length on that goal, and on how I think it might be best addressed.

DE Query Completion; Information Retrieval
AB Within a search engine, query auto-completion aims to predict the final query the user wants to enter as they type, with the aim of reducing query entry time and potentially preparing the search results in advance of query submission. There are a large number of approaches to automatically rank candidate queries for the purposes of auto-completion. However, no study exists that compares these approaches on a single dataset. Hence, in this paper, we present a comparison study between current approaches to rank candidate query completions for the user query as it is typed. Using a query-log and document corpus from a commercial medical search engine, we study the performance of 11 candidate query ranking approaches from the literature and analyze where they are effective. We show that the most effective approaches to query auto-completion are largely dependent on the number of characters that the user has typed so far, with the most effective approach differing for short and long prefixes. Moreover, we show that if personalized information is available about the searcher, this additional information can be used to more effectively rank query candidate completions, regardless of the prefix length.

AB The queries submitted by users to search engines often poorly describe their information needs and represent a potential bottleneck in the system. In this paper we investigate to what extent it is possible to aid users in learning how to formulate better queries by providing examples of high-quality queries interactively during a number of search sessions. By means of several controlled user studies we collect quantitative and qualitative evidence that shows: (1) study participants are able to identify and abstract qualities of queries that make them highly effective, (2) after seeing high-quality example queries participants are able to themselves create queries that are highly effective, and, (3) those queries look similar to expert queries as defined in the literature. We conclude by discussing what the findings mean in the context of the design of interactive search systems.

AB Searching for a particular person by specifying her name is one of the essential functions in online social networking services such as Facebook. So many times, however, one would like to find a person but what she knows is few social labels about the target, such as interests, skills, hometown, school, employment, etc. Assume each user is associated a set of social labels, we propose a novel search in online social network, Person-of-Interest (POI) Search, which aims to find a list of desired targets based on a set of user-specified query labels that depict the targets. We develop a greedy heuristic graph search algorithm, which finds the target who not only covers the query labels, but also either possesses better social interactions with peers or has higher social proximity towards the user. Experiments conducted on Facebook and Twitter datasets exhibit the satisfying accuracy and encourage more advanced efforts on POI search.

DE online evaluation; interleaving; A/B tests
AB Modern search engines increasingly rely on online evaluation methods such as A/B tests and interleaving. These online evaluation methods make use of interactions by the search engine's users to test various changes in the search engine. However, since the number of the user sessions per unit of time is limited, the number of simultaneously running on-line evaluation experiments is bounded. In an extreme case, it might be impossible to deploy all experiments since they arrive faster than are proccessed. Consequently, it is very important to efficiently use the limited resource of the user's interactions. In this paper, we formulate the novel problem of schedule optimisation for the queue of the online experiments: given a limited number of the user interactions available for experimentation, we want to re-order the queue so that the number of successful experiments is maximised. In order to build a schedule optimisation algorithm, we start by formulating a model of an online experimentation pipeline. Next, we propose to reduce the task of finding the optimal schedule to a learning-to-rank problem, where we require the most promising experiments to be ranked first in the schedule. To evaluate the proposed approach, we perform an evaluation study using two datasets containing 82 interleaving and 35 A/B test experiments, performed by a commercial search engine. We measure the quality of a schedule as the number of successful experiments executed under limited user interactions. Our proposed schedulers obtain improvements of up to 342% compared to the unoptimised baseline schedule on the dataset of interleaving experiments and up to 43% on the dataset of A/B tests.

DE Evaluation; bias; pool; test collection; TREC
AB For many tasks in evaluation campaigns, especially those modeling narrow domain-specific challenges, lack of participation leads to a potential pooling bias due to the scarce number of pooled runs. It is well known that the reliability of a test collection is proportional to the number of topics and relevance assessments provided for each topic, but also to same extent to the diversity in participation in the challenges. Hence, in this paper we present a new perspective in reducing the pool bias by studying the effect of merging an unpooled run with the pooled runs. We also introduce an indicator used by the bias correction method to decide whether the correction needs to be applied or not. This indicator gives strong clues about the potential of a "good" run tested on an "unfriendly" test collection (i.e. a collection where the pool was contributed to by runs very different from the one at hand). We demonstrate the correctness of our method on a set of fifteen test collections from the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC). We observe a reduction in system ranking error and absolute score difference error.

DE Learning to Rank; Query Selection; Active Learning; Submodularity
AB The performance of Learning to Rank algorithms strongly depend on the number of labelled queries in the training set, while the cost incurred in annotating a large number of queries with relevance judgements is prohibitively high. As a result, constructing such a training dataset involves selecting a set of candidate queries for labelling. In this work, we investigate query selection strategies for learning to rank aimed at actively selecting unlabelled queries to be labelled so as to minimize the data annotation cost. In particular, we characterize query selection based on two aspects of informativeness and representativeness and propose two novel query selection strategies (i) Permutation Probability based query selection and (ii) Topic Model based query selection which capture the two aspects, respectively. We further argue that an ideal query selection strategy should take into account both these aspects and as our final contribution, we present a submodular objective that couples both these aspects while selecting query subsets. We evaluate the quality of the proposed strategies on three real world learning to rank datasets and show that the proposed query selection methods results in significant performance gains compared to the existing state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Many queries, especially those in the form of longer questions, contain a subset of terms representing key concepts that describe the most important part of the user's information need. Detecting the key concepts in a query can be used as the basis for more effective weighting of query terms, but in this paper, we focus on a method of using the key concepts in a translation model for query expansion and retrieval. Translation models have been used previously in community-based question answering (CQA) systems in order to bridge the semantic gap between questions and the corresponding answer documents. Our method uses the key concepts of a question as the translation context and selectively applies the translation model to the secondary (non-key) parts of the question. We evaluate the proposed method using a CQA collection and show that selectively translating key and secondary concepts can significantly improve the retrieval performance compared to a baseline that applies the translation model without considering key concepts.

AB Mathematical Information Retrieval concerns retrieving information related to a particular mathematical concept. The NTCIR-11 Math Task develops an evaluation test collection for document sections retrieval of scientific articles based on human generated topics. Those topics involve a combination of formula patterns and keywords. Another task in NTCIR-11 is the optional Wikipedia Task, which provides a test collection for retrieval of individual mathematical formula from Wikipedia based on search topics that contain exactly one formula pattern. We developed a framework for automatic query generation and immediate evaluation. This paper discusses our dataset preparation, our topic generation and evaluation methods, and summarizes the results of the participants, with a special focus on the Wikipedia Task.

AB This paper studies Cumulative Citation Recommendation (CCR) for Knowledge Base Acceleration (KBA). The CCR task aims to detect potential citations of a set of target entities with priorities from a volume of temporally-ordered stream corpus. Previous approaches for CCR that build an individual relevance model for each entity fail to handle unseen entities without annotation. A baseline solution is to build a global entity-unspecific model for all entities regardless of the relationship information among entities, which cannot guarantee to achieve satisfactory result for each entity. In this paper, we propose a novel entity class-dependent discriminative mixture model by introducing a latent entity class layer to model the correlations between entities and latent entity classes. The model can better adjust to different types of entities and achieve better performance when dealing with a broad range of entities. An extensive set of experiments has been conducted on TREC-KBA-2013 dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve the state-of-the-art performance.

DE Web page segmentation; Web page classification; structured prediction;
   integer linear programming
AB We propose a framework which can perform Web page segmentation with a structured prediction approach. It formulates the segmentation task as a structured labeling problem on a transformed Web page segmentation graph (WPS-graph). WPS-graph models the candidate segmentation boundaries of a page and the dependency relation among the adjacent segmentation boundaries. Each labeling scheme on the WPS-graph corresponds to a possible segmentation of the page. The task of finding the optimal labeling of the WPS-graph is transformed into a binary Integer Linear Programming problem, which considers the entire WPS-graph as a whole to conduct structured prediction. A learning algorithm based on the structured output Support Vector Machine framework is developed to determine the feature weights, which is capable to consider the inter-dependency among candidate segmentation boundaries. Furthermore, we investigate its efficacy in supporting the development of automatic Web page classification.

DE product recommendation; unexplored category; price
AB State-of-the-art methods for product recommendation encounter significant performance drop in categories where a user has no purchase history. This problem needs to be addressed since current online retailers are moving beyond single category and attempting to be diversified.
   In this paper, we investigate the challenge problem of product recommendation in unexplored categories and discover that the price, a factor transferrable across categories, can improve the recommendation performance significantly. Through our investigation, we address four research questions progressively: 1) what is the impact of unexplored category on recommendation performance? 2) How to represent the price factor from the recommendation point of view? 3) What does price factor across categories mean to recommendation? 4) How to utilize price factor across categories for recommendation in unexplored categories? Based on a series of experiments and analysis conducted on a dataset collected from a leading E-commerce website, we discover valuable findings for the above four questions: first, unexplored categories cause performance drop by 40% relatively for current recommendation systems; second, the price factor can be represented as either a quantity for a product or a distribution for a user to improve performance; third, consumer behavior with respect to price factor across categories is complicated and needs to be carefully modeled; finally and most importantly, we propose a new method which encodes the two perspectives of the price factor. The proposed method significantly improves the recommendation performance in unexplored categories over the state-of-the-art baseline systems and shortens the performance gap by 43% relatively.

DE Risk-Sensitive Evaluation; Student's t Test
ID BOOTSTRAP
AB The aim of risk-sensitive evaluation is to measure when a given information retrieval (IR) system does not perform worse than a corresponding baseline system for any topic. This paper argues that risk-sensitive evaluation is akin to the underlying methodology of the Student's t test for matched pairs. Hence, we introduce a risk-reward tradeoff measure T-Risk that generalises the existing U-Risk measure (as used in the TREC 2013 Web track's risk-sensitive task) while being theoretically grounded in statistical hypothesis testing and easily interpretable. In particular, we show that T-Risk is a linear transformation of the t statistic, which is the test statistic used in the Student's t test. This inherent relationship between T-Ri(sk) and the t statistic, turns risk-sensitive evaluation from a descriptive analysis to a fully-fledged inferential analysis. Specifically, we demonstrate using past TREC data, that by using the inferential analysis techniques introduced in this paper, we can (1) decide whether an observed level of risk for an IR system is statistically significant, and thereby infer whether the system exhibits a real risk, and (2) determine the topics that individually lead to a significant level of risk. Indeed, we show that the latter permits a state-of-the-art learning to rank algorithm (Lamb-daMART) to focus on those topics in order to learn effective yet risk-averse ranking systems.

DE text classification; topic modelling; weakly supervised; semi supervised
AB Supervised text classifiers require extensive human expertise and labeling efforts. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised text classification algorithm based on the labeling of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topics. Our algorithm is based on the generative property of LDA. In our algorithm, we ask an annotator to assign one or more class labels to each topic, based on its most probable words. We classify a document based on its posterior topic proportions and the class labels of the topics. We also enhance our approach by incorporating domain knowledge in the form of labeled words. We evaluate our approach on four real world text classification datasets. The results show that our approach is more accurate in comparison to semi-supervised techniques from previous work. A central contribution of this work is an approach that delivers effectiveness comparable to the state-of-the-art supervised techniques in hard-to-classify domains, with very low overheads in terms of manual knowledge engineering.

ID WEB SEARCH
AB This study investigated query formulations by users with Cognitive Search Intents (CSIs), which are users' needs for the cognitive characteristics of documents to be retrieved, e.g. comprehensibility, subjectivity, and concreteness. Our four main contributions are summarized as follows: (i) we proposed an example-based method of specifying search intents to observe query formulations by users without biasing them by presenting a verbalized task description; (ii) we conducted a questionnaire-based user study and found that about half our subjects did not input any keywords representing CSIs, even though they were conscious of CSIs; (iii) our user study also revealed that over 50% of subjects occasionally had experiences with searches with CSIs, while our evaluations demonstrated that the performance of a current Web search engine was much lower when we not only considered users' topical search intents but also CSIs; and (iv) we demonstrated that a machine-learning-based query expansion could improve the performances for some types of CSIs. Our findings suggest users over-adapt to current Web search engines, and create opportunities to estimate CSIs with non-verbal user input.

DE burstiness; language models; temporal similarity
AB A large number of mainstream applications, like temporal search, event detection, and trend identification, assume knowledge of the timestamp of every document in a given textual collection. In many cases, however, the required timestamps are either unavailable or ambiguous. A characteristic instance of this problem emerges in the context of large repositories of old digitized documents. For such documents, the timestamp may be corrupted during the digitization process, or may simply be unavailable. In this paper, we study the task of approximating the timestamp of a document, so-called document dating. We propose a content-based method and use recent advances in the domain of term burstiness, which allow it to overcome the drawbacks of previous document dating methods, e.g. the fix time partition strategy. We use an extensive experimental evaluation on different datasets to validate the efficacy and advantages of our methodology, showing that our method outperforms the state of the art methods on document dating.

DE Collaborative Filtering; Tensor Factorization
AB Existing work on collaborative filtering (CF) is often based on the overall ratings the items have received. However, in many cases, understanding how a user rates each aspect of an item may reveal more detailed information about her preferences and thus may lead to more effective CF. Prior work has studied extracting/quantizing sentiments on different aspects from the reviews, based on which the unknown overall ratings are inferred. However, in that work, all the aspects are treated equally; while in reality, different users tend to place emphases on difference aspects when reaching the overall rating. For example, users may give a high rating to a movie just for its plot despite its mediocre performances. This emphasis on aspects varies for different users and different items. In this paper, we propose a method that uses tensor factorization to automatically infer the weights of different aspects in forming the overall rating. The main idea is to learn, through constrained optimization, a compact representation of a weight tensor indexed by three dimensions for user, item, and aspect, respectively. Overall ratings can then be predicted using the obtained weights. Experiments on a movie dataset show that our method compares favorably with three baseline methods.

DE Authorship attribution; co-training; very few labeled examples
AB Authorship attribution (AA) aims to identify the authors of a set of documents. Traditional studies in this area often assume that there are a large set of labeled documents available for training. However, in the real life, it is hard or expensive to collect a large set of labeled data. For example, in the online review domain, most reviewers (authors) only write a few reviews, which are not enough to serve as the training data for accurate classification.
   In this paper, we present a novel two-view co-training framework to iteratively identify the authors of a few unlabeled data to augment the training set. The key idea is to first represent each document as several distinct views, and then a co-training technique is adopted to exploit the large amount of unlabeled documents. Starting from 10 training texts per author, we systematically evaluate the effectiveness of co-training for authorship attribution with limited labeled data. Two methods and three views are investigated: logistic regression (LR) and support vector machines (SVM) methods, and character, lexical, and syntactic views. The experimental results show that LR is particularly effective for improving co-training in AA, and the lexical view performs the best among three views when combined with a LR classifier. Furthermore, the co-training framework does not make much difference between one classifier from two views and two classifiers from one view. Instead, it is the learning approach and the view that plays a critical role.

DE Search User Interfaces; Exploratory Search; Search Results
   Visualization; Log Analysis
AB People often use more than one query when searching for information. They revisit search results to re-find information and build an understanding of their search need through iterative explorations of query formulation. These tasks are not wellsupported by search interfaces and web browsers. We designed and built SearchPanel, a Chrome browser extension that supports people in their ongoing information seeking. This extension combines document and process metadata into an interactive representation of the retrieved documents that can be used for sense-making, navigation, and re-finding documents. In a realworld deployment spanning over two months, results show that SearchPanel appears to have been primarily used for complex information needs, in search sessions with long durations and high numbers of queries. When process metadata was present in the UI, searchers in explorative search sessions submitted more and longer queries and interacted more with the SERP. These results indicate that the process metadata features in SearchPanel seem to be of particular importance for exploratory search.

DE fusion; relevance feedback
AB Work on using relevance feedback for retrieval has focused on the single retrieved list setting. That is, an initial document list is retrieved in response to the query and feedback for the most highly ranked documents is used to perform a second search. We address a setting wherein the list for which feedback is provided results from fusing several intermediate retrieved lists. Accordingly, we devise methods that utilize the feedback while exploiting the special characteristics of the fusion setting. Specifically, the feedback serves two different, yet complementary, purposes. The first is to directly rank the pool of documents in the intermediate lists. The second is to estimate the effectiveness of the intermediate lists for improved re-fusion. In addition, we present a meta fusion method that uses the feedback for these two purposes simultaneously. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the merits of our approach. As a case in point, the retrieval performance is substantially better than that of using the relevance feedback as in the single list setting. The performance also substantially transcends that of a previously proposed approach to utilizing relevance feedback in fusion-based retrieval.

DE Image Search Summarization; Tag-based Image Search; Flickr
AB Most existing tag-based social image search engines present search results as a ranked list of images. which cannot be consumed by users in a natural and intuitive manner. in this paper, we present a novel concept-preserving image search results summarization algorithm named PRISM. PRISM exploits both visual features and tags of the search results to generate high quality summary, which not only breaks the results into visually and semantically coherent clusters but it also maximizes the coverage of the summary w.r.t the original search results. It first constructs a visual similarity graph where the nodes are images in the search results and the edges represent visual similarities between pairs of images. This graph is optimally decomposed and compressed into a set of concept-preserving subgraphs based on a set of summarization objectives. Images in a concept-preserving subgraph are visually and semantically cohesive and are described by a minimal set of tags or concepts. Lastly, one or more exemplar images from each subgraph is selected to form the exemplar summary of the result set. Through empirical study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PRISM against state-of-the-art image summarization and clustering algorithms.

DE All-pairs similarity search; load balancing; partitioning;
   competitiveness analysis
AB All pairs similarity search, used in many data mining and information retrieval applications, is a time consuming process. Although a partition-based approach accelerates this process by simplifying parallelism management and avoiding unnecessary I/O and comparison, it is still challenging to balance the computation load among parallel machines with a distributed architecture. This is mainly due to the variation in partition sizes and irregular dissimilarity relationship in large datasets. This paper presents a two-stage heuristic algorithm to improve the load balance and shorten the overall processing time. We analyze the optimality and competitiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrates its effectiveness using several datasets. We also describe a static partitioning algorithm to even out the partition sizes while detecting more dissimilar pairs. The evaluation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms a previously developed solution by up to 41% in the tested cases.

DE Event Extraction; Timeline Analysis; User behaviors; Latent Dirichlet
   Allocation
AB Social media such as Twitter has come to reflect the reaction of the general public to major events. Since posts are short and noisy, it is hard to extract reliable events based on word frequency. Even though an event term appears in a particularly low frequency, as long as at least one reliable user mentions the term, it should be extracted. This paper proposes an event extraction method which combines user reliability and timeline analysis. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model is adapted with the weights of event terms on timeline and reliable users to extract social events. The reliable users are detected on Twitter according to their tweeting behaviors: socially well-known users and active users. Reliable and low-frequency events can be detected based on reliable users In order to see the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a Korean tweet collection; the proposed model achieved 72% in precision. This shows that the LDA with timeline and reliable users is effective for extracting events on the Twitter test collection.

DE CTSUM; information certainty; multi-document summarization
AB People often read summaries of news articles in order to get reliable information about an event or a topic. However, the information expressed in news articles is not always certain, and some sentences contain uncertain information about the event. Existing summarization systems do not consider whether a sentence in news articles is certain or not. In this paper, we propose a novel system called CTSUM to incorporate the new factor of information certainty into the summarization task. We first analyze the sentences in news articles and automatically predict the certainty levels of sentences by using the support vector regression method with a few useful features. The predicted certainty scores are then incorporated into a summarization system with a graph-based ranking algorithm. Experimental results on a manually labeled dataset verify the effectiveness of the sentence certainty prediction technique, and experimental results on the DUC2007 dataset shows that our new summarization system cannot only produce summaries with better content quality, but also produce summaries with higher certainty.

DE Probabilistic Text Modeling; Latent Semantic Analysis; Text
   Classification
AB Topic models have been widely used for text analysis. Previous topic models have enjoyed great success in mining the latent topic structure of text documents. With many efforts made on endowing the resulting document-topic distributions with different motivations, however, none of these models have paid any attention on the resulting topic-word distributions. Since topic-word distribution also plays an important role in the modeling performance, topic models which emphasize only the resulting document-topic representations but pay less attention to the topic-term distributions are limited. In this paper, we propose the Orthogonalized Topic Model (OTM) which imposes an orthogonality constraint on the topic-term distributions. We also propose a novel model fitting algorithm based on the generalized Expectation-Maximization algorithm and the Newthon-Raphson method. Quantitative evaluation of text classification demonstrates that OTM outperforms other baseline models and indicates the important role played by topic orthogonalizing.

DE Hashing; Learning to rank; Structural SVM
AB Hashing techniques have been extensively investigated to boost similarity search for large-scale high-dimensional data. Most of the existing approaches formulate the their objective as a pair-wise similarity-preserving problem. In this paper, we consider the hashing problem from the perspective of optimizing a list-wise learning to rank problem and propose an approach called List-Wise supervised Hashing (LWH). In LWH, the hash functions are optimized by employing structural SVM in order to explicitly minimize the ranking loss of the whole list-wise permutations instead of merely the point-wise or pair-wise supervision. We evaluate the performance of LWH on two real-world data sets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method obtains a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art hashing approaches due to both structural large margin and list-wise ranking pursuing in a supervised manner.

AB Almost all text applications use the well known vector-space model for text representation and analysis. While the vector-space model has proven itself to be an effective and efficient representation for mining purposes, it does not preserve information about the ordering of the words in the representation. In this paper, we will introduce the concept of distance graph representations of text data. Such representations preserve distance and ordering information between the words, and provide a much richer representation of the underlying text. This approach enables knowledge discovery from text which is not possible with the use of a pure vector-space representation, because it loses much less information about the ordering of the underlying words. Furthermore, this representation does not require the development of new mining and management techniques. This is because the technique can also be converted into a structural version of the vector-space representation, which allows the use of all existing tools for text. In addition, existing techniques for graph and XML data can be directly leveraged with this new representation. Thus, a much wider spectrum of algorithms is available for processing this representation.

DE information retrieval; diversity; webgraphs
AB A set of words is often insufficient to express a user's information need. In order to account for various information needs associated with a query, diversification seems to be a reasonable strategy. By diversifying the result set, we increase the probability of results being relevant to the user's information needs when the given query is ambiguous. A diverse result set must contain a set of documents that cover various subtopics for a given query. We propose a graph based method which exploits the link structure of the web to return a ranked list that provides complete coverage for a query. Our method not only provides diversity to the results set, but also avoids excessive redundancy. Moreover, the probability of relevance of a document is conditioned on the documents that appear before it in the result list. We show the effectiveness of our method by comparing it with a query-likelihood model as the baseline.

DE Image Retrieval; CCD; Fusion; Normalization; Combination
AB Compact composite descriptors (CCDs) are global image features, capturing more than one types of information at the same time in a very compact representation. Their quality has so far been evaluated in retrieval from several homogeneous databases containing images of only the type that each CCD is intended for, and has been found better than other descriptors in the literature such as the MPEG-7 descriptors. In this study, we consider heterogeneous databases and investigate query-time fusion techniques for CCDs. The results show that fusion is beneficial, even with simple score normalization and combination methods due to the compatibility of the score distributions produced by the CCDs considered.

AB Query expansion is an effective method to improve the usability of multimedia search. Most existing multimedia search engines are able to automatically expand a list of textual query terms based on text search techniques, which can be called textual query expansion (TQE). However, the annotations (title and tag) around web videos are generally noisier for text-only query expansion and search matching. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal query expansion (MMQE) framework for web video search to solve the issue. Compared with traditional methods, MMQE provides a more intuitive query suggestion by transforming textual query to visual presentation based on visual clustering. Parallel to this, MMQE can enhance the process of search matching with strong pertinence of intent-specific query by joining textual, visual and social cues from both metadata and content of videos. Experimental results on real web videos from YouTube demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

DE Query Performance Prediction
AB Numerous studies have examined the ability of query performance prediction methods to estimate a query's quality for system effectiveness measures (such as average precision). However, little work has explored the relationship between these methods and user ratings of query quality. In this poster, we report the findings from an empirical study conducted on the TREC ClueWeb09 corpus, where we compared and contrasted user ratings of query quality against a range of query performance prediction methods. Given a set of queries, it is shown that user ratings of query quality correlate to both system effectiveness measures and a number of pre-retrieval predictors.

DE Link Detection; Entity Search; Wikipedia
AB We investigate the task of finding links from Wikipedia pages to external web pages. Such external links significantly extend the information in Wikipedia with information from the Web at large, while retaining the encyclopedic organization of Wikipedia. We use a language modeling approach to create a full-text and anchor text runs, and experiment with different document priors. In addition we explore whether social bookmarking site Delicious can be exploited to further improve our performance. We have constructed a test collection of 53 topics, which are Wikipedia pages on different entities. Our findings are that the anchor text index is a very effective method to retrieve home pages. Url class and anchor text length priors and their combination leads to the best results. Using Delicious on its own does not lead to very good results, but it does contain valuable information. Combining the best anchor text run and the Delicious run leads to further improvements.

AB Query translation is an important task in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) aiming to translate queries into languages used in documents. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the necessity of translating query terms, which might differ from one term to another. Some untranslated terms cause irreparable performance drop while others do not. We propose an approach to estimate the translation probability of a query term, which helps decide if it should be translated or not. The approach learns regression and classification models based on a rich set of linguistic and statistical properties of the term. Experiments on NTCIR-4 and NTCIR-5 English-Chinese CLIR, tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly improve CUR performance. An in-depth analysis is also provided for discussing the impact of untranslated out-of-vocabulary (OOV) query terms and translation quality of non-OOV query terms on CLIR performance.

AB Analyzing the large volume of online reviews would produce useful knowledge that could be of economic values to vendors and other interested parties. In particular, the sentiments expressed in the online reviews have been shown to be strongly correlated with the sales performance of products. In this paper, we present an adaptive sentiment analysis model called S-PLSA(+), which aims to capture the hidden sentiment factors in the reviews with the capability to be incrementally updated as more data become available. We show how S-PLSA(+)can be applied to sales performance prediction using an ARSA model developed in previous literature. A case study is conducted in the movie domain, and results from preliminary experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model.

DE Content-based Information Filtering; User Profiling; Curse of
   Dimensionality
AB The Vector Space Model has been and to a great extent still is the de facto choice for profile representation in content-based Information Filtering. However, user profiles represented as weighted keyword vectors have inherent dimensionality problems. As the number of profile keywords increases, the vector representation becomes ambiguous, due to the exponential increase in the volume of the vector space and in the number of possible keyword combinations. We argue that the complexity and dynamics of Information Filtering require user profile representations which are resilient and resistant to this "curse of dimensionality". A user profile has to be able to incorporate many features and to adapt to a variety of interest changes. We propose an alternative, network-based profile representation that meets these challenging requirements. Experiments show that the network profile representation can more effectively capture additional information about a user's interests and thus achieve significant performance improvements over a vector-based representation comprising the same weighted keywords.

ID REGRESSION
AB Sponsored search is one of the major sources of revenue for search engines on the World Wide Web. It has been observed that while showing ads for every query maximizes short-term revenue, irrelevant ads lead to poor user experience and less revenue in the long-term. Hence, it is in search engines' interest to pace ads only for queries that are likely to attract ad-clicks. Many algorithms for estimating query advertisability exist in literature, but most of these methods have been proposed for and tested on the frequent or "head" queries. Since query frequencies on search engine are known to be distributed as a power-law, this leaves a huge fraction of the queries uncovered.
   In this paper we focus on the more challenging problem of estimating query advertisability for infrequent or "tail" queries. These require fundamentally different methods than head queries: for e.g., tail queries are almost all unique and require the estimation method to be online and inexpensive. We show that previously proposed methods do not apply to tail queries, and when modified for our scenario they do not work well. Further, we give a simple, yet effective, approach, which estimates query advertisability using only the words present in the queries. We evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset consisting of search engine queries and user clicks. Our results show that our simple approach outperforms a more complex one based on regularized regression.

The presence of user generated information with valuable opinions makes this field of huge interest. hi this poster we use part of this information, the readers' comments, to improve the quality of post snippets with the objective of enhancing the user access to the relevant posts in a result list. We propose a simple method for snippet generation based on sentence selection, using the comments to guide the selection process. We evaluated our approach with standard TREC methodology in the Blogs06 collection showing significant improvements up to 32% in terms of MAP over the baseline.

AB In this paper, we define a new query expansion method that relies on term similarity metric derived from the electric resistance network. This proposed metric lets us measure the mutual relevancy in between terms and between their groups. This paper shows how to define this metric automatically from the document collection, and then apply it in query expansion for document retrieval tasks. The experiments show this method can be used to find good expansion terms of search queries and improve document retrieval performance on two TREC genomic track datasets.

AB Logs of users' searches on Web health topics can exhibit signs of escalation of medical concerns, where initial queries about common symptoms are followed by queries about serious, rare illnesses. We present an effort to predict such escalations based on the structure and content of pages encountered during medical search sessions. We construct and then characterize the performance of classifiers that predict whether an escalation will occur after the access of a page. Our findings have implications for ranking algorithms and the design of search interfaces.

AB In this paper, we propose a probabilistic survival model derived from the survival analysis theory for measuring aspect novelty. The retrieved documents' query-relevance and novelty are combined at the aspect level for re-ranking. Experiments conducted on the TREC 2006 and 2007 Genomics collections demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in promoting ranking diversity for biomedical information retrieval.

DE Web Pronunciation extraction; Pronunciation normalization; Spoken Term
   Detection; Open vocabulary
AB Indexing and retrieval of speech content in various forms such as broadcast news, customer care data and on-line media has gained a lot of interest for a wide range of applications, from customer analytics to on-line media search. For most retrieval applications, the speech content is typically first converted to a lexical or phonetic representation using automatic speech recognition (ASR). The first step in searching through indexes built on these representations is the generation of pronunciations for named entities and foreign language query terms. This paper summarizes the results of the work conducted during the 2008 JHU Summer Workshop by the Multilingual Spoken Term Detection team, on mining the web for pronunciations and analyzing their impact. on spoken term detection. We will first present methods to use the vast amount of pronunciation information available on the Web, in the form of IPA and ad-hoc transcriptions. We describe techniques for extracting candidate pronunciations from Web pages and associating them with orthographic words, filtering out poorly extracted pronunciations, normalizing IPA pronunciations to better conform to a common transcription standard, and generating phonemic representations from ad-hoc transcriptions. We then present an analysis of the effectiveness of using these pronunciations to represent Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) query terms on the performance of a spoken term detection (STD) system. We will provide comparisons of Web pronunciations against automated techniques for pronunciation generation as well as pronunciations generated by human experts. Our results cover a range of speech indexes based on lattices, confusion networks and one-best transcriptions at both word and word fragments levels.

DE Stopping behavior; recall estimates; user study; decision making
AB This paper investigates subjects' stopping behaviors and estimates of recall in an interactive information retrieval (IIR) experiment. Subjects completed four recall-oriented search tasks and were asked to estimate how many of the relevant documents they believed they had found after each task. Subjects also responded to an interview question probing their reasons for stopping a search. Results show that most subjects believed they found about 51-60% of the relevant documents and that this estimate was correlated positively with number of documents saved and actual recall, even though subjects' recall estimates were inaccurate. Reasons given for stopping search are also explored.

DE Topic model; document clustering
AB Documents in many corpora, such as digital libraries and webpages, contain both content and link information. To explicitly consider the document relations represented by links, in this paper we propose a citation-topic (CT) model which assumes a probabilistic generative process for corpora. In the CT model a given document is modeled as a mixture of a set of topic distributions, each of which is borrowed (cited) from a document that is related to the given document. Moreover, the CT model contains a random process for selecting the related documents according to the structure of the generative model determined by links and therefore, the transitivity of the relations among documents is captured. We apply the CT model on the document clustering task and the experimental comparisons against several state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate very promising performances.

AB It has been observed that many queries submitted to search engines are location-sensitive. Traditional search techniques fail to interpret the significance of such geographical clues and as such are unable to return highly relevant search results. Although there have been efforts in the literature to support location-aware information retrieval, critical challenges still remain in terms of search result quality and data scalability. In this paper, we propose an innovative probabilistic ranking framework for domain information retrieval where users are interested in a set of location-sensitive topics. Our proposed method recognizes the geographical distribution of topic influence in the process of ranking documents and models it accurately using probabilistic Gaussian Process classifiers. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ranking framework by implementing it in a Web search service for NBA news. Extensive performance evaluation is performed on real Web document collections, which confirms that our proposed mechanism works significantly better (around 29.7% averagely using DCG(20) measure) than other popular location-aware information retrieval techniques in ranking quality.

AB In opinion-finding, the retrieval system is tasked with retrieving not just relevant documents, but those that also express art opinion towards the query target entity. This task has been studied in the context of the blogosphere by groups participating in the 2006-2008 TREC Blog tracks. Spam blogs (splogs) are thought to be a problem on the blogosphere. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which spam has affected the participating groups' retrieval systems over the three years of the TREC Blog track opinion-finding task. Our results show that spam can be an issue, with most systems retrieving some spam for every topic. However, removing spam from the rankings does not markedly change the relative performance of opinion-finding approaches.

AB Recently there has been a surge in research that predicts retrieval relevance using historical click-through data[5]. While a larger number of clicks between a query and a document provides a stronger "confidence" of relevance, most models in the literature that learn from clicks are error-prone as they do not take into account any confidence estimates. Sponsored Search models are especially prone to this error as they axe typically trained on search engine logs in order to predict click-through-rate (CTR). The estimated CTR ultimately determines the rank at which an ad is shown and also impacts the price (cost-per-click) for the advertiser. In this paper, we improve a model that applies collaborative filtering on click data by training a filter that has been trained to predict pure relevance. Applying the filter to ads that have seen few clicks on live traffic results in improved CTR and click-yield (CY). Additionally, in offline experiments we find that using features based on the organic results improves the relevance based filter's performance.

AB Link analysis methods have been used successfully for knowledge discovery from the link structure of mutually linking entities. Existing link analysis methods have been inherently designed based on the fact that the entire link structure of the target graph is observable such as public web documents; however, link information in graphs in the real world, such as human relationship or economic activities, is rarely open to public. If link analysis can be performed using graphs with private links in a privacy-preserving way, it enables us to rank entities connected with private ties, such as people, organizations, or business transactions. In this paper, we present a secure link analysis for graphs with private links by means of cryptographic protocols. Our solutions are designed as privacy-preserving expansions of well-known link analysis methods, PageRank and HITS. The outcomes of our protocols are completely equivalent to those of PageRank and HITS. Furthermore, our protocols theoretically guarantee that the private link information possessed by each node is not revealed to other nodes.

AB The analysis of search transaction logs often characterizes a search session but rarely looks at the end point. When do users stop, and what cues are present suggesting that stopping is eminent? In this preliminary analysis of the logs of 288 search sessions conducted in a laboratory setting, we identified the activity performed by participants as well as search transitions that were invoked over the course of a search session. The 4331 search transitions (15 per task on average) contained a total of 9295 actions. We isolated the final transition in each search session for detailed analysis. As hypothesized some behaviours are predictable, and suggestive of stopping behavior, with the potential for modeling.

DE Learning to rank; local ranking context; deep neural network
AB Learning to rank has been intensively studied and widely applied in information retrieval. Typically, a global ranking function is learned from a set of labeled data, which can achieve good performance on average but may be suboptimal for individual queries by ignoring the fact that relevant documents for different queries may have different distributions in the feature space. Inspired by the idea of pseudo relevance feedback where top ranked documents, which we refer as the local ranking context, can provide important information about the query's characteristics, we propose to use the inherent feature distributions of the top results to learn a Deep Listwise Context Model that helps us fine tune the initial ranked list. Specifically, we employ a recurrent neural network to sequentially encode the top results using their feature vectors, learn a local context model and use it to re-rank the top results. There are three merits with our model: (1) Our model can capture the local ranking context based on the complex interactions between top results using a deep neural network; (2) Our model can be built upon existing learning-to-rank methods by directly using their extracted feature vectors; (3) Our model is trained with an attention-based loss function, which is more effective and efficient than many existing listwise methods. Experimental results show that the proposed model can significantly improve the state-of-the-art learning to rank methods on benchmark retrieval corpora.

AB Web Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs) are complex responses to queries, containing many heterogeneous result elements (web results, advertisements, and specialised "answers") positioned in a variety of layouts. This poses numerous challenges when trying to measure the quality of a SERP because standard measures were designed for homogeneous ranked lists.
   In this paper, we aim to measure the utility and cost of SERPs. To ground this work we adopt the C/W/L framework which enables a direct comparison between different measures in the same units of measurement, i.e. expected (total) utility and cost. Within this framework, we propose a new measure based on information foraging theory, which can account for the heterogeneity of elements, through different costs, and which naturally motivates the development of a user stopping model that adapts behaviour depending on the rate of gain. This directly connects models of how people search with how we measure search, providing a number of new dimensions in which to investigate and evaluate user behaviour and performance.
   We perform an analysis over 1000 popular queries issued to a major search engine, and report the aggregate utility experienced by users over time. Then in an comparison against common measures, we show that the proposed foraging based measure provides a more accurate reflection of the utility and of observed behaviours (stopping rank and time spent).

AB This tutorial surveys neural approaches to conversational AI that were developed in the last few years. We group conversational systems into three categories: (1) question answering agents, (2) task-oriented dialogue agents, and (3) social bots. For each category, we present a review of state-of-the-art neural approaches, draw the connection between neural approaches and traditional symbolic approaches, and discuss the progress we have made and challenges we are facing, using specific systems and models as case studies.

DE Recruitment Analysis; Person-Job Fit; Neural Network
AB The wide spread use of online recruitment services has led to information explosion in the job market. As a result, the recruiters have to seek the intelligent ways for Person-Job Fit, which is the bridge for adapting the right job seekers to the right positions. Existing studies on Person-Job Fit have a focus on measuring the matching degree between the talent qualification and the job requirements mainly based on the manual inspection of human resource experts despite of the subjective, incomplete, and inefficient nature of the human judgement. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Ability-aware Person-Job Fit Neural Network (APJFNN) model, which has a goal of reducing the dependence on manual labour and can provide better interpretation about the fitting results. The key idea is to exploit the rich information available at abundant historical job application data. Specifically, we propose a word-level semantic representation for both job requirements and job seekers' experiences based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Along this line, four hierarchical ability-aware attention strategies are designed to measure the different importance of job requirements for semantic representation, as well as measuring the different contribution of each job experience to a specific ability requirement. Finally, extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world data set clearly validate the effectiveness and interpretability of the APJFNN framework compared with several baselines.

DE Weighted Sequential Dependence Model; Term Dependencies; Word
   Embeddings; Query Expansion; Pseudo-Relevance Feedback
AB Although information retrieval models based on Markov Random Fields (MRF), such as Sequential Dependence Model and Weighted Sequential Dependence Model (WSDM), have been shown to outperform bag-of-words probabilistic and language modeling retrieval models by taking into account term dependencies, it is not known how to effectively account for term dependencies in query expansion methods based on pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) for retrieval models of this type. In this paper, we propose Semantic Weighted Dependence Model (SWDM), a PRF based query expansion method for WSDM, which utilizes distributed low-dimensional word representations (i.e., word embeddings). Our method finds the closest unigrams to each query term in the embedding space and top retrieved documents and directly incorporates them into the retrieval function of WSDM. Experiments on TREC datasets indicate statistically significant improvement of SWDM over state-of-the-art MRF retrieval models, PRF methods for MRF retrieval models and embedding based query expansion methods for bag of-words retrieval models.

AB We develop a probabilistic formulation giving rise to a formal version of heuristic k nearest-neighbor (kNN) collaborative filtering. Different independence assumptions in our scheme lead to user based, item-based, normalized and non-normalized variants that match in structure the traditional formulations, while showing equivalent empirical effectiveness. The probabilistic formulation provides a principled explanation why kNN is an effective recommendation strategy, and identifies a key condition for this to be the case. Moreover, a natural explanation arises for the bias of kNN towards recommending popular items. Thereupon the kNN variants are shown to fall into two groups with similar trends in behavior, corresponding to two different notions of item popularity. We show experiments where the comparative performance of the two groups of algorithms changes substantially, which suggests that the performance measurements and comparison may heavily depend on statistical properties of the input data sample.

DE Social Media; User Profile; User Behavior
AB User interests and expertise are valuable but often hidden resources on social media. For example, Twitter Lists and Linkedln's Skill Tags provide a partial perspective on what users are known for (by aggregating crowd tagging knowledge), but the vast majority of users are untagged; their interests and expertise are essentially hidden from important applications such as personalized recommendation, community detection, and expert mining. A natural approach to overcome these limitations is to intelligently learn user topical profiles by exploiting information from multiple, heterogeneous footprints: for instance, Twitter users who post similar hashtags may have similar interests, and YouTube users who upvote the same videos may have similar preferences. And yet identifying "similar" users by exploiting similarity in such a footprint space often provides conflicting evidence, leading to poor-quality user profiles. In this paper, we propose a unified model for learning user topical profiles that simultaneously considers multiple footprints. We show how these footprints can be embedded in a generalized optimization framework that takes into account pairwise relations among all footprints for robustly learning user profiles. Through extensive experiments, we find the proposed model is capable of learning high-quality user topical profiles, and leads to a 10-15% improvement in precision and mean average error versus a cross triadic factorization state-of-the-art baseline.

AB Query suggestions help users refine their queries after they input an initial query. We consider the task of generating query suggestions that are personalized and diversified. We propose a personalized query suggestion diversification model (PQSD), where a user's long-term search behavior is injected into a basic greedy query suggestion diversification model (G-QSD) that considers a user's search context in their current session. Query aspects are identified through clicked documents based on the Open Directory Project (ODP). We quantify the improvement of PQSD over a state-of-theart baseline using the AOL query log and show that it beats the baseline in terms of metrics used in query suggestion ranking and diversification. The experimental results show that PQSD achieves the best performance when only queries with clicked documents are taken as search context rather than all queries.

DE aesthetics assessment; label distribution learning; image search
AB Aesthetics has become increasingly prominent for image search to enhance user satisfaction. Therefore, image aesthetics assessment is emerging as a promising research topic in recent years. In this paper, distinguished from existing studies relying on a single label, we propose to quantify the image aesthetics by a distribution over quality levels. The distribution representation can effectively characterize the disagreement among the aesthetic perceptions of users regarding the same image. Our framework is developed on the foundation of label distribution learning, in which the reliability of training examples and the correlations between quality levels are fully taken into account. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets well verified the potential of our approach for aesthetics assessment. The role of aesthetics in image search was also rigorously investigated.

DE Semantic query annotation; Learning to rank; Intent-aware
AB Query understanding is a challenging task primarily due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language. A common strategy for improving the understanding of natural language queries is to annotate them with semantic information mined from a knowledge base. Nevertheless, queries with different intents may arguably benefit from specialized annotation strategies. For instance, some queries could be effectively annotated with a single entity or an entity attribute, others could be better represented by a list of entities of a single type or by entities of multiple distinct types, and others may be simply ambiguous. In this paper, we propose a framework for learning semantic query annotations suitable to the target intent of each individual query. Thorough experiments on a publicly available benchmark show that our proposed approach can significantly improve state-of-the-art intent-agnostic approaches based on Markov random fields and learning to rank. Our results further demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of our approach for queries of various target intents, lengths, and difficulty levels, as well as its robustness to noise in intent detection.

DE Entity cards; entity summarization; user interfaces
AB Entity cards are being used frequently in modern web search engines to offer a concise overview of an entity directly on the results page. These cards are composed of various elements, one of them being the entity summary: a selection of fack describing the entity from an underlying knowledge base. These summaries, while presenting a synopsis of the entity, can also directly address users' information needs. In this paper, we make the first effort towards generating and evaluating such factual summaries. We introduce and address the novel problem of dynamic entity summarization,for entity cards, and break it down to two specific sublasks: fad ranking and summary generation. We perform an extensive evaluation of our method using crowdsourcing. Our results show the effectiveness of our fact ranking approach and validate that users prefer dynamic summaries over static ones.

ID SPACE
AB We propose a new class of methods for learning vector space embed dings of entities. While most existing methods focus on modelling similarity, our primary aim is to learn embeddings that are interpretable, in the sense that query terms have a direct geometric representation in the vector space. Intuitively, we want all entities that have some property (i.e. for which a given term is relevant) to be located in some well-defined region of the space. This is achieved by imposing max-margin constraints that are derived from a bag of -words representation of the entities. The resulting vector spaces provide us with a natural vehicle for identifying entities that have a given property (or ranking them according to how much they have the property), and conversely, to describe what a given set of entities have in common. As we show in our experiments, our models lead to a substantially better performance in a range of entity-oriented search tasks, such as list completion and entity ranking.

ID STRATEGIES
AB To enhance effectiveness, a user's query can be rewritten internally by the search engine in many ways, for example by applying proximity, or by expanding the query with related terms. However, approaches that benefit effectiveness often have a negative impact on effciency, which has impacts upon the user satisfaction, if the query is excessively slow. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for using the predicted execution time of various query rewritings to select between alternatives on a per-query basis, in a manner that ensures both effectiveness and effciency. In particular, we propose the prediction of the execution time of ephemeral (e.g., proximity) posting lists generated from uni-gram inverted index posting lists, which are used in establishing the permissible query rewriting alternatives that may execute in the allowed time. Experiments examining both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach demonstrate that a 49% decrease in mean response time (and 62% decrease in 95th-percentile response time) can be attained without significantly hindering the effectiveness of the search engine.

DE search tasks; bayesian non-parametrics; hierarchical model
AB A significant amount of search queries originate from some real world information need or tasks [13]. In order to improve the search experience of the end users, it is important to have accurate representations of tasks. As a result, significant amount of research has been devoted to extracting proper representations of tasks in order to enable search systems to help users complete their tasks, as well as providing the end user with better query suggestions [9], for better recommendations [11], for satisfaction prediction [36] and for improved personalization in terms of tasks [24, 38]. Most existing task extraction methodologies focus on representing tasks as flat structures. However, tasks often tend to have multiple subtasks associated with them and a more naturalistic representation of tasks would be in terms of a hierarchy, where each task can be composed of multiple (sub)tasks. To this end, we propose an efficient Bayesian nonparametric model for extracting hierarchies of such tasks & subtasks. We evaluate our method based on real world query log data both through quantitative and crowdsourced experiments and highlight the importance of considering task/subtask hierarchies.

AB It has been shown that people attempt to accomplish a variety of intentions during the course of an information seeking session, and there is reason to believe that these different information seeking intentions can benefit from system support tailored to each such intention. We address the problem of predicting the presence of such intentions during an information seeking session, through analysis of observable user search behaviors. We present results of a study of 40 participants, each working on two different journalism tasks, which investigated how their search behaviors could indicate their intentions. Using 725 query-segments captured from this study, we demonstrate that information seeking intentions can be predicted with a simple classification model using a linear combination of search behavior features that can be logged with a browser plug-in.

AB Finding talented users on Stackoverflow can be a challenging task due to term mismatch between queries and content published on it. In this paper, we propose two translation models to augment a given query with relevant words. The first model is based on a statistical approach and the second one is a word embedding model. Interestingly, the translations provided by these methods are not the same. Although the first model in most cases selects pieces of program codes as translations, the second model provides more semantically related words. Our experiments on a large dataset indicate the efficiency of proposed models.

AB This paper introduces a test collection for evaluating the effectiveness of different methods used to retrieve research studies for inclusion in systematic reviews. Systematic reviews appraise and synthesise studies that meet specific inclusion criteria. Systematic reviews intended for a biomedical science audience use boolean queries with many, often complex, search clauses to retrieve studies; these are then manually screened to determine eligibility for inclusion in the review. This process is expensive and time consuming. The development of systems that improve retrieval effectiveness will have an immediate impact by reducing the complexity and resources required for this process. Our test collection consists of approximately 26 million research studies extracted from the freely available MEDLINE database, 94 review (query) topics extracted from Cochrane systematic reviews, and corresponding relevance assessments. Tasks for which the collection can be used for information retrieval system evaluation are described and the use of the collection to evaluate common baselines within one such task is demonstrated. The test collection is available at http s://github. com/ielab/SIGIR2017- PI C 0- Collection.

AB Due to Twitter's terms of service that forbid redistribution of content, creating publicly downloadable collections of tweets for research purposes has been a perpetual problem for the research community. Some collections are distributed by making available the ids of the tweets that comprise the collection and providing tools to fetch the actual content; this approach has scalability limitations. In other cases, evaluation organizers have set up APIs that provide access to collections for specific tasks, without exposing the underlying content. This is a workable solution, but difficult to sustain over the long term since someone has to maintain the APIs. We have noticed that the non-profit Internet Archive has been making available for public download captures of the so-called Twitter "spritzer" stream, which is the same source as the Tweets2013 collection used in the TREC 2013 and 2014 Microblog Tracks. We analyzed both datasets in terms of content overlap and retrieval baselines to show that the Internet Archive data can serve as a drop in replacement for the Tweets2013 collection, thereby providing the research community with, finally, a downloadable collection of tweets. Beyond this finding, we also study the impact of tweet deletions over time and how they affect the test collections.

AB Given the diversity of recommendation algorithms, choosing one technique is becoming increasingly difficult. In this paper, we explore methods for combining multiple recommendation approaches. We studied rank aggregation methods that have been proposed for the metasearch task (i.e., fusing the outputs of different search engines) but have never been applied to merge top-N recommender systems. These methods require no training data nor parameter tuning. We analysed two families of methods: voting-based and score based approaches. These rank aggregation techniques yield significant improvements over state-of-the-art top-N recommenders. In particular, score-based methods yielded good results; however, some voting techniques were also competitive without using score information, which may be unavailable in some recommendation scenarios. The studied methods not only improve the state of the art of recommendation algorithms but they are also simple and efficient.

DE Network Representation Learning; Link Prediction
AB In this paper, we propose a predictive network representation learning (PNRL) model to solve the structural link prediction problem. The proposed model defines two learning objectives, i.e., observed structure preservation and hidden link prediction. To integrate the two objectives in a unified model, we develop an effective sampling strategy to select certain edges in a given network as assumed hidden links and regard the rest network structure as observed when training the model. By jointly optimizing the two objectives, the model can not only enhance the predictive ability of node representations but also learn additional link prediction knowledge in the representation space. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the other popular and state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Image search engines show results differently from general Web search engines in three key ways: (1) most Web-based image search engines adopt the two-dimensional result placement instead of the linear result list; (2) image searches show snapshots instead of snippets (query-dependent abstracts of landing pages) on search engine result pages (SERPs); and (3) pagination is usually not (explicitly) supported on image search SERPs, and users can view results without having to click on the "next page" button. Compared with the extensive study of user behavior in general Web search scenarios, there exists no thorough investigation how the different interaction mechanism of image search engines affects users' examination behavior. To shed light on this research question, we conducted an eye-tracking study to investigate users' examination behavior in image searches. We focus on the impacts of factors in examination including position, visual saliency, edge density, the existence of textual information, and human faces in result images. Three interesting findings indicate users' behavior biases: (1) instead of the traditional "Golden Triangle" phenomena in the user examination patterns of general Web search, we observe a middle-position bias, (2) besides the position factor, the content of image results (e.g., visual saliency) affects examination behavior, and (3) some popular behavior assumptions in general Web search (e.g., examination hypothesis) do not hold in image search scenarios. We predict users' examination behavior with different impact factors. Results show that combining position and visual content features can improve prediction in image searches.

DE video question answering; visual information retrieval; attribute
AB Video Question Answering is a challenging problem in visual information retrieval, which provides the answer to the referenced video content according to the question. However, the existing visual question answering approaches mainly tackle the problem of static image question, which may be ineffectively for video question answering due to the insufficiency of modeling the temporal dynamics of video contents. In this paper, we study the problem of video question answering by modeling its temporal dynamics with frame-level attention mechanism. We propose the attribute augmented attention network learning framework that enables the joint frame-level attribute detection and unified video representation learning for video question answering. We then incorporate the multi-step reasoning process for our proposed attention network to further improve the performance. We construct a large-scale video question answering dataset. We conduct the experiments on both multiple-choice and open-ended video question answering tasks to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Spatiotemporal activity modeling is an important task for applications like tour recommendation and place search. The recently developed geographical topic models have demonstrated compelling results in using geo-tagged social media (GTSM) for spatiotemporal activity modeling. Nevertheless, they all operate in batch and cannot dynamically accommodate the latest information in the GTSM stream to reveal up-to-date spatiotemporal activities. We propose REACT, a method that processes continuous GTSM streams and obtains recency-aware spatiotemporal activity models on the fly. Distinguished from existing topic-based methods, REACT embeds all the regions, hours, and keywords into the same latent space to capture their correlations. To generate high-quality embeddings, it adopts a novel semi-supervised multimo dal embedding paradigm that leverages the activity category information to guide the embedding process. Furthermore, as new records arrive continuously, it employs strategies to effectively incorporate the new information while preserving the knowledge encoded in previous embeddings. Our experiments on the geo-tagged tweet streams in two major cities have shown that REACT significantly outperforms existing methods for location and activity retrieval tasks.

AB Urbanization's rapid progress has modernized a large number of human beings' lives. This urbanization progress is accompanied by the increase of a variety of shops (e.g., restaurants and fitness centers) to meet the increasing citizens, which means business opportunities for the investors. Nevertheless, it is difficult for the investors to catch such opportunities because opening what kind of business at which place is not easy to decide. In this paper, we take this challenge and define the business opportunity mining problem, which recommends new business categories at a partitioned business district. Specifically, we exploit the data from location-based social networks (LBSNs) to mine the business opportunities, guiding the business owners to open new commercial shops in certain categories at a particular area. First, we define the properties of a business district and propose a greedy algorithm to partition a city into different districts. Next, we propose an embedding model to learn latent representations of categories, which captures the functional correlations among business categories. Furthermore, we propose a ranking model based on the pairwise loss to recommend categories for a specific district. Finally, we conduct experiments on Yelp data, and experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline methods and resolves the problem well.

ID QUERIES
AB Modern search engines utilize users' search history for personalization, which provides more effective, useful and relevant search results. However, it also has the potential risk of revealing users' privacy by identifying their underlying intention from their logged search behaviors. To address this privacy issue, we proposed a Topic-based Privacy Protection solution on client side. In our solution, each user query will be submitted with k additional cover queries, which will act as a proxy to disguise users' intent from a search engine. The set of cover queries are generated in a controlled way so that each query carries similar uncertainty to randomize a user's search history while still providing necessary utility for the search engine to perform personalization. We used statistical topic models to infer topics from the original user query and generated cover queries of similar entropy but from unrelated topics. Extensive experiments are performed on AOL search log and the promising results demonstrated the effectiveness of our solution.

ID RELEVANCE FEEDBACK
AB Search is an inherently interactive, non-deterministic and user-dependent process. This means that there are many different possible sequences of interactions which could be taken (some ending in success and others ending in failure). Simulation provides a low cost, repeatable and reproducible way to explore a large range of different possibilities. This makes simulation very appealing, but it also requires care and consideration in developing, implementing and instantiating models of user behaviour for the purposes of experimentation.
   In this tutorial, we aim to provide researchers with an overview of simulation, detailing the various types of simulation, models of search behavior used to simulate interaction, along with an overview of the various models of querying, stopping, selecting and marking. Through the course of the tutorial we will describe various studies and how they have used simulation to explore different behaviours and aspects of the search process. The final section of the tutorial will be dedicated to "best practice" and how to build, ground and validate simulations. The tutorial will conclude with a demonstration of an open source simulation framework that can be used develop various kinds of simulations.

AB Online ranker evaluation is a key challenge in information retrieval. An important task in the online evaluation of rankers is using implicit user feedback for inferring preferences between rankers. Interleaving methods have been found to be efficient and sensitive, i.e. they can quickly detect even small differences in quality. It has recently been shown that multileaving methods exhibit similar sensitivity but can be more efficient than interleaving methods. This paper presents empirical results demonstrating that existing multileaving methods either do not scale well with the number of rankers, or, more problematically, can produce results which substantially differ from evaluation measures like NDCG. The latter problem is caused by the fact that they do not correctly account for the similarities that can occur between rankers being multileaved. We propose a new multileaving method for handling this problem and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms existing methods, in some cases reducing errors by as much as 50%.

AB Concerns over personalization in IR have sparked an interest in detection and analysis of controversial topics. Accurate detection would enable many beneficial applications, such as alerting search users to controversy. Wikipedia's broad coverage and rich metadata offer a valuable resource for this problem. We hypothesize that intensities of controversy among related pages are not independent. Thus, we propose a stacked model which exploits the dependencies among related pages. Our approach improves classification of controversial web pages when compared to a model that examines each page in isolation, demonstrating that controversial topics exhibit homophily. Using notions of similarity to construct a subnetwork for collective classification, rather than using the default network present in the relational data, leads to improved classification with wider applications for semi-structured datasets, with the effects most pronounced when a small set of neighbors is used.

AB Test collections have a long history of supporting repeatable and comparable evaluation in Information Retrieval (IR). However, thus far, no shared test collection exists for IR systems that are designed to index and retrieve multimodal lifelog data. In this paper we introduce the first test collection for personal lifelog data, which has been employed for the NTCIR12-Lifelog task. In this paper, the requirements for the test collection are motivated, the process of creating the test collection is described, along with an overview of the test collection. Finally suggestions are given for possible applications of the test collection.

DE Review summarization; Question retrieval; Diversification
AB Product reviews have become an important resource for customers before they make purchase decisions. However, the abundance of reviews makes it difficult for customers to digest them and make informed choices. In our study, we aim to help customers who want to quickly capture the main idea of a lengthy product review before they read the details. In contrast with existing work on review analysis and document summarization, we aim to retrieve a set of real-world user questions to summarize a review. In this way, users would know what questions a given review can address and they may further read the review only if they have similar questions about the product. Specifically, we design a two-stage approach which consists of question retrieval and question diversification. We first propose probabilistic retrieval models to locate candidate questions that are relevant to a review. We then design a set function to re-rank the questions with the goal of rewarding diversity in the final question set. The set function satisfies submodularity and monotonicity, which results in an efficient greedy algorithm of submodular optimization. Evaluation on product reviews from two categories shows that the proposed approach is effective for discovering meaningful questions that are representative for individual reviews.

ID RETRIEVAL
AB Despite the growing importance of exploratory search, information retrieval (IR) systems tend to focus on lookup search. Lookup searches are well served by optimising the precision and recall of search results, however, for exploratory search this may be counterproductive if users are unable to formulate an appropriate search query. We present a system called PULP that supports exploratory search for scientific literature, though the system can be easily adapted to other types of literature. PULP uses reinforcement learning (RL) to avert the user from context traps resulting from poorly chosen search queries, trading off between exploration (presenting the user with diverse topics) and exploitation (moving towards more specific topics). Where other RL-based systems suffer from the "cold start" problem, requiring sufficient time to adjust to a user's information needs, PULP initially presents the user with an overview of the dataset using temporal topic models. Topic models are displayed in an interactive alluvial diagram, where topics are shown as ribbons that change thickness with a given topics relative prevalence over time. Interactive, exploratory search sessions can be initiated by selecting topics as a starting point.

DE Search tasks; Multitasking; User Behavior
AB While a major share of prior work have considered search sessions as the focal unit of analysis for seeking behavioral insights, search tasks are emerging as a competing perspective in this space. In the current work, we quantify user search task behavior for both single-as well as multi-task search sessions and relate it to tasks and topics. Specifically, we analyze user-disposition, topic and user-interest level heterogeneities that are prevalent in search task behavior. Our results show that while search multi-tasking is a common phenomenon among the search engine users, the extent and choice of multi-tasking topics vary significantly across users. We find that not only do users have varying propensities to multi-task, they also search for distinct topics across single-task and multi-task sessions. To our knowledge, this is among the first studies to fully characterize online search tasks with a focus on user- and topic-level differences that are observable from search sessions.

AB Social Media (SM) has become a valuable information source to many in diverse situations. In IR, research has focused on real-time aspects and as such little is known about how long SM content is of value to users, if and how often it is re-accessed, the strategies people employ to re-access and if difficulties are experienced while doing so. We present results from a 5 month-long naturalistic, log-based study of user interaction with Twitter, which suggest re-finding to be a regular activity and that Tweets can offer utility for longer than one might think. We shed light on re-finding strategies revealing that remembered people are used as a stepping stone to Tweets rather than searching for content directly. Bookmarking strategies reported in the literature are used infrequently as a means to re-access. Finally, we show that by using statistical modelling it is possible to predict if a Tweet has future utility and is likely to be re-found. Our findings have implications for the design of social media search systems and interfaces, in particular for Twitter, to better support users re-find previously seen content.

DE Email; search; productivity
AB Emails continue to remain the most important and widely used mode of online communication despite having its origins in the middle of last century and being threatened by a variety of online communication innovations. While several studies have predicted the continuous growth of volume of email communication, there is little innovation on improving the search in emails, an imperative part of the user experience. In this work, we present a lightweight email application codenamed InLook, that intends to provide a productive search experience.

AB There are two well-known versions of the t-test for comparing means from unpaired data: Student's t-test and Welch's t-test. While Welch's t-test does not assume homoscedasticity (i.e., equal variances), it involves approximations. A classical textbook recommendation would be to use Student's t-test if either the two sample sizes are similar or the two sample variances are similar, and to use Welch's t-test only when both of the above conditions are violated. However, a more recent recommendation seems to be to use Welch's t-test unconditionally. Using past data from both TREC and NTCIR, the present study demonstrates that the latter advice should not be followed blindly in the context of IR system evaluation. More specifically, our results suggest that if the sample sizes differ substantially and if the larger sample has a substantially larger variance, Welch's t-test may not be reliable.

AB The rapidly growing paradigm of the Internet of Things (IoT) requires new search engines, which can crawl heterogeneous data sources and search in highly dynamic contexts. Existing search engines cannot meet these requirements as they are designed for traditional Web and human users only. This is contrary to the fact that things are emerging as major producers and consumers of information. Currently, there is very little work on searching IoT and a number of works claim the unavailability of public IoT data. However, it is dismissed that a majority of real-time web-based maps are sharing data that is generated by things, directly. To shed light on this line of research, in this paper, we firstly create a set of tools to capture IoT data from a set of given data sources. We then create two types of interfaces to provide real-time searching services on dynamic IoT data for both human and machine users.

AB Social media offers potential opportunities for businesses to extract business intelligence. This paper presents Tweetviz, an interactive tool to help businesses extract actionable information from a large set of noisy Twitter messages. Tweetviz visualizes the tweet sentiment of business locations, identifies other business venues that Twitter users visit, and estimates some simple demographics of the Twitter users frequenting a business. A user study to evaluate the system's ability indicates that Tweetviz can provide an overview of a business's issues and sentiment as well as information aiding users in creating customer profiles.

AB Web crawls provide valuable snapshots of the Web which enable a wide variety of research, be it distributional analysis to characterize Web properties or use of language, content analysis in social science, or Information Retrieval (IR) research to develop and evaluate effective search algorithms. While many English-centric Web crawls exist, existing public Arabic Web crawls are quite limited, limiting research and development. To remedy this, we present ArabicWeb16, a new public Web crawl of roughly 150M Arabic Web pages with significant coverage of dialectal Arabic as well as Modern Standard Arabic. For IR researchers, we expect ArabicWeb16 to support various research areas: ad-hoc search, question answering, filtering, cross-dialect search, dialect detection, entity search, blog search, and spam detection.

AB Investor social media, such as StockTwist, are gaining increasing popularity. These sites allow users to post their investing opinions and suggestions in the form of microblogs. Given the growth of the posted data, a significant and challenging research problem is how to utilize the personal wisdom and different viewpoints in these opinions to help investment. Previous work aggregates sentiments related to stocks and generates buy or hold recommendations for stocks obtaining favorable votes while suggesting sell or short actions for stocks with negative votes. However, considering the fact that there always exist unreasonable or misleading posts, sentiment aggregation should be improved to be robust to noise. In this paper, we improve investment recommendation by modeling and using the quality of each investment opinion. To model the quality of an opinion, we use multiple categories of features generated from the author information, opinion content and the characteristics of stocks to which the opinion refers. Then, we discuss how to perform investment recommendation (including opinion recommendation and portfolio recommendation) with predicted qualities of investor opinions. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate effectiveness of our work in recommending high-quality opinions and generating profitable investment decisions.

AB Discovering the author's interest over time from documents has important applications in recommendation systems, authorship identification and opinion extraction. In this paper, we propose an interest drift model (IDM), which monitors the evolution of author interests in time-stamped documents. The model further uses the discovered author interest information to help finding better topics. Unlike traditional topic models, our model is sensitive to the ordering of words, thus it extracts more information from the semantic meaning of the context. The experiment results show that the IDM model learns better topics than state-of-the-art topic models.

DE Query Expansion; Supervised Learning; Efficiency
AB Query expansion (QE) is a well known technique to improve retrieval effectiveness, which expands original queries with extra terms that are predicted to be relevant. A recent trend in the literature is Supervised Query Expansion (SQE), where supervised learning is introduced to better select expansion terms. However, an important but neglected issue for SQE is its efficiency, as applying SQE in retrieval can be much more time-consuming than applying Unsupervised Query Expansion (UQE) algorithms. In this paper, we point out that the cost of SQE mainly comes from term feature extraction, and propose a Two-stage Feature Selection framework (TFS) to address this problem. The first stage is adaptive expansion decision, which determines if a query is suitable for SQE or not. For unsuitable queries, SQE is skipped and no term features are extracted at all, which reduces the most time cost. For those suitable queries, the second stage is cost constrained feature selection, which chooses a subset of effective yet inexpensive features for supervised learning. Extensive experiments on four corpora (including three academic and one industry corpus) show that our TFS framework can substantially reduce the time cost for SQE, while maintaining its effectiveness.

DE Learning to rank; Underperforming queries
ID EXPLOITATION; EXPLORATION
AB Ranking documents using their historical click-through rate (CTR) can improve relevance for frequently occurring queries, i.e., so-called head queries. It is difficult to use such click signals on non-head queries as they receive fewer clicks. In this paper, we address the challenge of dealing with torso queries on which the production ranker is performing poorly. Torso queries are queries that occur frequently enough so that they are not considered as tail queries and yet not frequently enough to be head queries either. They comprise a large portion of most commercial search engines' traffic, so the presence of a large number of underperforming torso queries can harm the overall performance significantly. We propose a practical method for dealing with such cases, drawing inspiration from the literature on learning to rank (LTR). Our method requires relatively few clicks from users to derive a strong re-ranking signal by comparing document relevance between pairs of documents instead of using absolute numbers of clicks per document. By infusing a modest amount of exploration into the ranked lists produced by a production ranker and extracting preferences between documents, we obtain substantial improvements over the production ranker in terms of page-level online metrics. We use an exploration dataset consisting of real user clicks from a large-scale commercial search engine to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. We conduct further experimentation on public benchmark data using simulated clicks to gain insight into the inner workings of the proposed method. Our results indicate a need for LTR methods that make more explicit use of the query and other contextual information.

DE search; streams; evaluation
AB People track news events according to their interests and available time. For a major event of great personal interest, they might check for updates several times an hour, taking time to keep abreast of all aspects of the evolving event. For minor events of more marginal interest, they might check back once or twice a day for a few minutes to learn about the most significant developments. Systems generating streams of updates about evolving events can improve user performance by appropriately filtering these updates, making it easy for users to track events in a timely manner without undue information overload. Unfortunately, predicting user performance on these systems poses a significant challenge. Standard evaluation methodology, designed for Web search and other adhoc retrieval tasks, adapts poorly to this context. In this paper, we develop a simple model that simulates users checking the system from time to time to read updates. For each simulated user, we generate a trace of their activities alternating between away times and reading times. These traces are then applied to measure system effectiveness. We test our model using data from the TREC 2013 Temporal Summarization Track (TST) comparing it to the effectiveness measures used in that track. The primary TST measure corresponds most closely with a modeled user that checks back once a day on average for ail average of one minute. Users checking more frequently for longer times may view the relative performance of participating systems quite differently. In light of this sensitivity to user behavior, we recommend that future experiments be built around clearly stated assumptions regarding user interfaces and access patterns, with effectiveness measures reflecting these assumptions.

DE Power Consumption; CPU Frequency Scaling; Search Engines
AB Web search engine companies require power-hungry data centers with thousands of servers to efficiently perform searches on a large scale. This permits the search engines to serve high arrival rates of user queries with low latency, but poses economical and environmental concerns due to the power consumption of the servers. Existing power saving techniques sacrifice the raw performance of a server for reduced power absorption, by scaling the frequency of the server's CPU according to its utilization. For instance, current Linux kernels include frequency governors i.e., mechanisms designed to dynamically throttle the CPU operational frequency. However, such general-domain techniques work at the operating system level and have no knowledge about the querying operations of the server. In this work, we propose to delegate CPU power management to search engine-specific governors. These can leverage knowledge coming from the querying operations, such as the query server utilization and load. By exploiting such additional knowledge, we can appropriately throttle the CPU frequency thereby reducing the query server power consumption. Experiments are conducted upon the TREC ClueWeb09 corpus and the query stream from the MSN 2006 query log. Results show that we can reduce up to similar to 24% a server power consumption, with only limited drawbacks in effectiveness w.r.t. a system running at maximum CPU frequency to promote query processing quality.

AB In this paper, a real case study on opinion spammer detection in web forum is presented. We explore user profiles, maximum spamicity of first posts of users, burstiness of registration of user accounts, and frequent poster set to build a model with SVM with RBF kernel and frequent itemset mining The proposed model achieves 0.6753 precision, 0.6190 recall, and 0.6460 F1 score. The result is promising because the ratio of opinion spammers in the test set is only 0.98%.

AB Continuous active learning achieves high recall for technology-assisted review, not only for an overall information need, but also for various facets of that information need, whether explicit or implicit. Through simulations using Cormack and Grossman's TAR Evaluation Toolkit (SIGIR 2014), we show that continuous active learning, applied to a multi-faceted topic, efficiently achieves high recall for each facet of the topic. Our results assuage the concern that continuous active learning may achieve high overall recall at the expense of excluding identifiable categories of relevant information.

   sign-aware metric; A/B test
AB Modern Internet companies improve evaluation criteria of their data-driven decision-making that is based on online controlled experiments (also known as A/B tests). The amplitude metrics of user engagement are known to be well sensitive to service changes, but they could not be used to determine, whether the treatment effect is positive or negative. We propose to overcome this sign-agnostic issue by paying attention to the phase of the corresponding DFT sine wave. We refine the amplitude metrics of the first frequency by the phase ones and formalize our intuition in several novel overall evaluation criteria. These criteria are then verified over A/B experiments on real users of Yandex. We find that our approach holds the sensitivity level of the amplitudes and makes their changes sign-aware w.r.t. the treatment effect.

   framework; Language models
AB Many generative language and relevance models assume conditional independence between the likelihood of observing individual terms. This assumption is obviously naive, but also hard to replace or relax. There are only very few term pairs that actually show significant conditional dependencies while the vast majority of co-located terms has no implications on the document's topical nature or relevance towards a given topic. It is exactly this situation that we capture in a formal framework: A limited number of meaningful dependencies in a system of largely independent observations. Making use of the formal copula framework, we describe the strength of causal dependency in terms of a number of established term co-occurrence metrics. Our experiments based on the well known Clue Web'12 corpus and TREC 2013 topics indicate significant performance gains in terms of retrieval performance when we formally account for the dependency structure underlying pieces of natural language text.

DE Evaluation Metric; Rank Correlation Coefficient
AB Information retrieval systems rank documents, and shared-task evaluations yield results that can be used to rank information retrieval systems. Comparing rankings in ways that can yield useful insights is thus an important capability. When making such comparisons, it is often useful to give greater weight to comparisons near the head of a ranked list than to what happens further down. This is the focus of the widely used tau(AP) measure. When scores are available, gap-sensitive measures give greater weight to larger differences than to smaller ones. This is the focus of the widely used Pearson correlation measure (rho). This paper introduces a new measure, tau(GAP), which combines both features. System comparisons from the TREC 5 Ad Hoc track are used to illustrate the differences in emphasis achieved by tau(AP), rho, and the proposed tau(GAP).

ID RECOGNITION
AB We study the problem of subsequence search in databases of event-interval sequences, or e-sequences. In contrast to sequences of instantaneous events, e-sequences contain events that have a duration. In Information Retrieval applications, e-sequences are used for American Sign Language. We show that the subsequence-search problem is NP-hard and provide an exact (worst-case exponential) algorithm. We extend our algorithm to handle different cases of subsequence matching with errors. We then propose the Relation Index, a scheme for speeding up exact retrieval, which we benchmark against several indexing schemes.

   Matrix Factorization
ID SYSTEMS
AB Data sparsity and cold-start are two major problems in personalized recommendation. They are especially severe in business recommendation, because business transactions are usually completed offline and customers generally do not provide ratings after a transaction. Due to these two problems, matrix factorization (MF) models, which are shown to be effective in many recommendation tasks, are likely to fail on business recommendation tasks, especially for new users and new items. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Bias and Factorization Model (IBFM), which exploits user and business attributes. The user attributes include demographic information, vote information, point-of-interests; the business attributes include check-in information, locations, business names, categories, etc. To handle the cold-start problem, we employ a sampling strategy to generate the latent factor vectors for new users and new businesses based on similar users/businesses. Our methods are evaluated on the data set used in the RecSys 2013 Yelp business rating prediction challenge. Experimental results show that our proposed methods significantly outperform several existing state-of-the-art methods. In particular, the single model IBFM performs the best in this challenge on both public and private leaderboards.

DE Relevance labels; agreement vs. accuracy; judgments collection workflow
AB Expert judgments (labels) are widely used in Information Retrieval for the purposes of search quality evaluation and machine learning. Setting up the process of collecting such judgments is a challenge of its own, and the maintenance of judgments quality is an extremely important part of the process. One of the possible ways of controlling the quality is monitoring inter-assessor agreement level. But does the agreement level really reflect the quality of assessor's judgments? Indeed, if a group of assessors comes to a consensus, to what extent should we trust their collective opinion? In this paper, we investigate, whether the agreement level can be used as a metric for estimating the quality of assessor's judgments, and provide recommendations for the design of judgments collection workflow. Namely, we estimate the correlation between assessors' accuracy and agreement in the scope of several workflow designs and investigate which specific workflow features influence the accuracy of judgments the most.

AB Crowdsourcing became an essential tool for a broad range of Web applications. Yet, the wide-ranging levels of expertise of crowd workers as well as the presence of faulty workers call for quality control of the crowdsourcing result. To this end, many crowd sourcing platforms feature a post-processing phase, in which crowd answers are validated by experts. This approach incurs high costs though, since expert input is a scarce resource. To support the expert in the validation process, we present a tool for ExpeRt guidance In validating Crowd Answers (ERICA). It allows us to guide the expert's work by collecting input on the most problematic cases, thereby achieving a set of high quality answers even if the expert does not validate the complete answer set. The tool also supports the task requester in selecting the most cost-efficient allocation of the budget between the expert and the crowd.

AB While watching television, people increasingly consume additional content related to what they are watching. We consider the task of finding video content related to a live television broadcast for which we leverage the textual stream of subtitles associated with the broadcast. We model this task as a Markov decision process and propose a method that uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the retrieval effectiveness of queries generated from the stream of subtitles. Our dynamic query modeling approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for stationary query modeling and for text-based retrieval in a television setting. In particular we find that carefully weighting terms and decaying these weights based on recency significantly improves effectiveness. Moreover, our method is highly efficient and can be used in a live television setting, i.e., in near real time.

DE Document ranking; Retrieval model; Extreme value theory
AB The main goal of a retrieval model is to measure the degree of relevance of a document with respect to the given query. Probabilistic models are widely used to measure the likelihood of relevance of a document by combining within document term frequency and term specificity in a formal way. Recent research shows that tf normalization that factors in multiple aspects of term salience is an effective scheme. However, existing models do not fully utilize these tf normalization components in a principled way. Moreover, most state of the art models ignore the distribution of a term in the part of the collection that contains the term. In this article, we introduce a new probabilistic model of ranking that addresses the above issues. We argue that, since the relevance of a document increases with the frequency of the query term, this assumption can be used to measure the likelihood that the normalized frequency of a term in a particular document will be maximum with respect to its distribution in the elite set. Thus, the weight of a term in a document is proportional to the probability that the normalized frequency of that term is maximum under the hypothesis that the frequencies are generated randomly. To that end, we introduce a ranking function based on maximum value distribution that uses two aspects of tf normalization. The merit of the proposed model is demonstrated on a number of recent large web collections. Results show that the proposed model outperforms the state of the art models by significantly large margin.

AB Current search engines offer limited assistance for exploration and information discovery in complex search tasks. Instead, users are distracted by the need to focus their cognitive efforts on finding navigation cues, rather than selecting relevant information. Interactive intent modeling enhances the human information exploration capacity through computational modeling, visualized for interaction. Interactive intent modeling has been shown to increase task-level information seeking performance by up to 100%. In this demonstration, we showcase SciNet, a system implementing interactive intent modeling on top of a scientific article database of over 60 million documents.

ID ENTITY RANKING
AB Wikipedia - the online encyclopedia - has long been used as a source of information for researchers, as well as being a subject of research itself [11, 12, 23, 5, 6]. Wikipedia has been shown to be effective in recommender systems, sentiment analysis, validation and multiple domains in information retrieval. One of the reasons for Wikipedia's popularity among researchers and practitioners is the multiple types of information it contains, which enables practitioners to select the right "tool" for their respective tasks. In addition to its great potential, this multitude of information sources also poses a challenge: which sources of information are best suited for a specific problem and how can different types of data be combined?
   This tutorial aims to provide a holistic view of Wikipedia's different features - text, links, categories, page views, editing history etc. - and explore the different ways they can be utilized in a machine learning framework. By presenting and contrasting the latest works that utilize Wikipedia in multiple domains, this tutorial aims to increase the awareness among researchers and practitioners in these fields to the benefits of utilizing Wikipedia in their respective domains, in particular to the use of multiple sources of information simultaneously.

ID DECISIONS
AB People's tendency to overly rely on prior information has been well studied in psychology in the context of anchoring and adjustment. Anchoring biases pervade many aspects of human behavior. in this paper, we present a study of anchoring bias in information retrieval (IR) settings. We provide strong evidence of anchoring during the estimation of document relevance via both human relevance judging and in natural user behavior collected via search log analysis. In particular, we show that sequential relevance judgment of documents collected for the same query could be subject to anchoring bias. That is, the human annotators are likely to assign different relevance labels to a document, depending on the quality of the last document they had judged for the same query. In addition to manually assigned labels, we further show that the implicit relevance labels inferred from click logs can also be affected by anchoring bias. Our experiments over the query logs of a commercial search engine suggested that searchers' interaction with a document can be highly affected by the documents visited Munediately beforehand. Our findings have implications for the design of search systems and judgment methodologies that consider and adapt to anchoring effects.

DE Spoken Retrieval; Search Result Summarisation; Crowdsourcing
AB Presenting search results over a speech-only communication channel involves a number of challenges for users due to cognitive limitations and the serial nature of speech. We investigated the impact of search result summary length in speech-based web search, and compared our results to a text baseline. Based on crowdsourced workers, we found that users preferred longer, more informative summaries for text presentation. For audio, user preferences depended on the style of query. For single-facet queries, shortened audio summaries were preferred, additionally users were found to judge relevance with a similar accuracy compared to text-based summaries. For multi-facet queries, user preferences were not as clear, suggesting that more sophisticated techniques are required to handle such queries.

DE Temporal Ranking; Web Archive; Authority; Diversity
AB Due to their first-hand, diverse and evolution-aware reflection of nearly all areas of life, web archives are emerging as gold-mines for content analytics of many sorts. However, supporting search, which goes beyond navigational search via URLs, is a very challenging task in these unique structures with huge, redundant and noisy temporal content. In this paper, we address the search needs of expert users such as journalists, economists or historians for discovering a topic in time: Given a query, the top-k returned results should give the best representative documents that cover most interesting time-periods for the topic. For this purpose, we propose a novel random walk-based model that integrates relevance, temporal authority, diversity and time in a unified framework. Preliminary experimental results on a large-scale, real-world web archival collection shows that our method significantly improves the state-of-the-art algorithms (i.e., PageRank) in ranking temporal web pages.

DE procedural knowledge base; search log; query suggestion; search intent
AB Many search engine users attempt to satisfy an information need by issuing multiple queries, with the expectation that each result will contribute some portion of the required information. Previous research has shown that structured or semi-structured descriptive knowledge bases (such as Wikipedia) can be used to improve search quality and experience for general or entity-centric queries. However, such resources do not have sufficient coverage of procedural knowledge, i.e. what actions should be performed and what factors should be considered to achieve some goal; such procedural knowledge is crucial when responding to task-oriented search queries. This paper provides a first attempt to bridge the gap between two evolving research areas: development of procedural knowledge bases (such as wikiHow) and task-oriented search. We investigate whether task-oriented search can benefit from existing procedural knowledge (search task suggestion) and whether automatic procedural knowledge construction can benefit from users' search activities (automatic procedural knowledge base construction). We propose to create a three-way parallel corpus of queries, query contexts, and task descriptions, and reduce both problems to sequence labeling tasks. We propose a set of textual features and structural features to identify key search phrases from task descriptions, and then adapt similar features to extract wikiHow-style procedural knowledge descriptions from search queries and relevant text snippets. We compare our proposed solution with baseline algorithms, commercial search engines, and the (manually-curated) wikiHow procedural knowledge; experimental results show an improvement of +0.28 to +0.41 in terms of Precision@8 and mean average precision (MAP).

DE User engagement; transfer learning; multi-task learning; adaptive model
AB User engagement evaluation task in social networks has recently attracted considerable attention due to its applications in recommender systems. In this task, the posts containing users' opinions about items, e.g., the tweets containing the users' ratings about movies in the IMDb website, are studied. In this paper, we try to make use of tweets from different web applications to improve the user engagement evaluation performance. To this aim, we propose an adaptive method based on multi-task learning. Since in this paper we study the problem of detecting tweets with positive engagement which is a highly imbalanced classification problem, we modify the loss function of multi-task learning algorithms to cope with the imbalanced data. Our evaluations over a dataset including the tweets of four diverse and popular data sources, i.e., IMDb, YouTube, Goodreads, and Pandora, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our findings suggest that transferring knowledge between data sources can improve the user engagement evaluation performance.

AB The task of information retrieval (IR) has traditionally been defined as to rank a collection of documents in response to a query. While this definition has enabled most research progress in IR so far, it does not model accurately the actual retrieval task in a real IR application, where users tend to be engaged in an interactive process with multipe queries, and optimizing the overall performance of an IR system on an entire search session is far more important than its performance on an individual query.
   In this talk, I will present a new game-theoretic formulation of the IR problem where the key idea is to model information retrieval as a process of a search engine and a user playing a cooperative game, with a shared goal of satisfying the user's information need (or more generally helping the user complete a task) while minimizing the user's effort and the resource overhead on the retrieval system. Such a game-theoretic framework offers several benefits. First, it naturally suggests optimization of the overall utility of an interactive retrieval system over a whole search session, thus breaking the limitation of the traditional formulation that optimizes ranking of documents for a single query. Second, it models the interactions between users and a search engine, and thus can optimize the collaboration of a search engine and its users, maximizing the "combined intelligence" of a system and users. Finally, it can serve as a unified framework for optimizing both interactive information retrieval and active relevance judgment acquisition through crowdsourcing. I will discuss how the new framework can not only cover several emerging directions in current IR research as special cases, but also open up many interesting new research directions in IR.

DE Aggregated search; federated search; click models; evaluation
AB Modeling user behavior on a search engine result page is important for understanding the users and supporting simulation experiments. As result pages become more complex, click models evolve as well in order to capture additional aspects of user behavior in response to new forms of result presentation.
   We propose a method for evaluating the intuitiveness of vertical-aware click models, namely the ability of a click model to capture key aspects of aggregated result pages, such as vertical selection, item selection, result presentation and vertical diversity. This method allows us to isolate model components and therefore gives a multifaceted view on a model's performance. We argue that our method can be used in conjunction with traditional click model evaluation metrics such as log-likelihood or perplexity. In order to demonstrate the power of our method in situations where result pages can contain more than one type of vertical (e.g., Image and News) we extend the previously studied Federated Click Model such that it models user clicks on such pages. Our evaluation method yields non-trivial yet interpretable conclusions about the intuitiveness of click models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.

DE Evaluation; TREC; Topics
AB In this work, we investigate approaches to engineer better topic sets in information retrieval test collections. By recasting the TREC evaluation exercise from one of building more effective systems to an exercise in building better topics, we present two possible approaches to quantify topic "goodness": topic ease and topic set predictivity. A novel interpretation of a well known result and a twofold analysis of data from several TREC editions lead to a result that has been neglected so far: both topic ease and topic set predictivity have changed significantly across the years, sometimes in a perhaps undesirable way.

DE Social network; exploratory search; people search
AB LinkedIn is the world's largest professional network, with over 300 million members. One of the primary activities on the site is people search, for which LinkedIn members are both the users and the corpus. This paper presents insights about people search behavior on LinkedIn, based on a log analysis and a user study. In particular, it examines the role that network distance plays in name searches and non-name searches. For name searches, users primarily click on only one of the results, and closer network distance leads to higher click-through rates. In contrast, for non-name searches, users are more likely to click on multiple results that are not in their existing connections, but with whom they have shared connections. The results show that, while network distance contributes significantly to LinkedIn search engagement in general, its role varies dramatically depending on the type of search query.

DE Diversity; Score Difference; Clustering
AB We investigate the application of a light-weight approach to result list clustering for the purposes of diversifying search results. We introduce a novel post-retrieval approach, which is independent of external information or even the full-text content of retrieved documents; only the retrieval score of a document is used. Our experiments show that this novel approach is beneficial to effectiveness, albeit only on certain baseline systems. The fact that the method works indicates that the retrieval score is potentially exploitable in diversity.

DE Measurement; Experimentation
AB We present a study to understand the effect that negated terms (e.g., "no fever") and family history (e.g., "family history of diabetes") have on searching clinical records. Our analysis is aimed at devising the most effective means of handling negation and family history. In doing so, we explicitly represent a clinical record according to its different content types: negated, family history and normal content; the retrieval model weights each of these separately. Empirical evaluation shows that overall the presence of negation harms retrieval effectiveness while family history has little effect. We show negation is best handled by weighting negated content (rather than the common practise of removing or replacing it). However, we also show that many queries benefit from the inclusion of negated content and that negation is optimally handled on a per-query basis. Additional evaluation shows that adaptive handing of negated and family history content can have significant benefits.

DE Interaction Relationship; Social Recommendation; Microblog
   Recommendation
AB With the development of microblog services, tens of thousands of messages are produced every day and recommending useful messages according to users' interest is recognized as an effective way to overcome the information overload problem. Collaborative filtering which rooted from recommender system has been utilized for microblog recommendation, where social relationship information can help improve the recommendation performance. However, most of existing methods only consider the static relationship, i.e. the following relationship, which totally ignore the relationship conveyed by users' repost behaviors. To explore the effects of behavior based relationship on recommendation, we propose an Interaction Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF) approach. Specifically, we first use topic model to analyze users' interactive behaviors and measure the topic-specific relationship strength, then we incorporate the relationship factor into the matrix factorization framework. Experimental results show that compared to the current popular social recommendation methods, IBCF can achieve better performance on the MAP and NDCG evaluation measures, and have better interpretability for the recommended results.

DE Event Detection; Event Visualization; Social Media
AB In recent years, social media has become one of the most popular tools for discovering and following breaking news and ongoing events. However tools and interfaces have lagged behind users' expectations, with current tools making it difficult to discover new events and failing to provide a solution to the problem of information overload. We have developed an interactive interface for visualizing events, backed by a state-of-the-art event detection approach, which is able to detect, track and summarize events in real-time. Our interface provides up-to-the-second information about ongoing events in an easy to understand manner, including category information, temporal distribution, and location information - all of which was previously unobtainable in real-time.

DE Web Search Results Clustering; Dual C-means; Automatic Labeling;
   Evaluation
AB Different important studies in Web search results clustering have recently shown increasing performances motivated by the use of external resources. Following this trend, we present a new algorithm called Dual C-Means, which provides a theoretical background for clustering in different representation spaces. Its originality relies on the fact that external resources can drive the clustering process as well as the labeling task in a single step. To validate our hypotheses, a series of experiments are conducted over different standard datasets and in particular over a new dataset built from the TREC Web Track 2012 to take into account query logs information. The comprehensive empirical evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its significant advantages over traditional clustering and labeling techniques.

DE location-based service; places-of-interest; image recognition
AB This paper presents a project called Knowing Camera for real-time recognizing and annotating places-of-interest(POI) in smartphone photos, with the availability of online geotagged images of such places. We propose a "Spatial+Visual" (S+V) framework which consists of a probabilistic field-of-view model in the spatial phase and sparse coding similarity metric in the visual phase to recognize phone-captured POIs. Moreover, we put forward an offline Collaborative Salient Area (COSTAR) mining algorithm to detect common visual features (called Costars) among the noisy photos geotagged on each POI, thus to clean the geotagged image database. The mining result can be utilized to annotate the region-of-interest on the query image during the online query processing. Besides, this mining procedure further improves the efficiency and accuracy of the S+V framework. Our experiments in the real-world and Oxford 5K datasets show promising recognition and annotation performances of the proposed approach, and that the proposed COSTAR mining technique outperforms state-of-the-art approach.

DE Ad-hoc Retrieval; Query Performance Prediction; Query Expansion
AB Query Performance Prediction (QPP) is the estimation of the retrieval success for a query, without explicit knowledge about relevant documents. QPP is especially interesting in the context of Automatic Query Expansion (AQE) based on Pseudo Relevance Feedback (PRF). PRF-based AQE is known to produce unreliable results when the initial set of retrieved documents is poor. Theoretically, a good predictor would allow to selectively apply PRF-based AQE when performance of the initial result set is good enough, thus enhancing the overall robustness of the system. QPP would be of great benefit in the context of microblog retrieval, as AQE was the most widely deployed technique for enhancing retrieval performance at TREC. In this work we study the performance of the state of the art predictors under microblog retrieval conditions as well as introducing our own predictors. Our results show how our proposed predictors outperform the baselines significantly.

DE Right-click query; Context-aware search; Query expansion
AB Many queries are submitted to search engines by right-clicking the marked text (i.e., the query) in Web browsers. Because the document being read by the searcher often provides sufficient contextual information for the query, search engine could provide much more relevant search results if the query is augmented by the contextual information captured from the source document. How to extract the right contextual information from the source document is the main focus of this study. To this end, we evaluate 7 text component extraction schemes, and 5 feature extraction schemes. The former determines from which text component (e.g., title, meta-data, or paragraphs containing the selected query) to extract contextual information; the latter determines which words or phrases to extract. In total 35 combinations are evaluated and our evaluation results show that noun phrases extracted from all paragraphs that contain the query word is the best option.

   Information Retrieval; MIR; query-by-expression
AB To use math expressions in search, current search engines require knowing expression names or using a structure editor or string encoding (e.g., LaTeX). For mathematical non-experts, this can lead to an "intention gap" between the query they wish to express and what the interface will allow them to express. m(in) is a search interface that supports drawing expressions on a canvas using mouse/touch, keyboard and images. We present a user study examining whether m(in) changes search behavior for mathematical non-experts, and to identify real-world usage scenarios for multimodal math search interfaces. Participants found query-byexpression using hand-drawn input useful, and identified scenarios in which they would like to use systems like m(in) such as for locating, editing and sharing complex expressions (e.g., with many Greek letters), and working on complex math problems.

DE Link Analysis; Similarity Search; SimRank; Singular Graph
AB SimRank is an attractive structural-context measure of similarity between two objects in a graph. It recursively follows the intuition that "two objects are similar if they are referenced by similar objects". The best known matrix-based method [1] for calculating SimRank, however, implies an assumption that the graph is non-singular, i.e., its adjacency matrix is invertible. In reality, non-singular graphs are very rare; such an assumption in [1] is too restrictive in practice. In this paper, we provide a treatment of [1], by supporting similarity assessment on non-invertible adjacency matrices. Assume that a singular graph G has n nodes, with r (< n) being the rank of its adjacency matrix. (1) We show that SimRank matrix S on G has an elegant structure: S can be represented as a rank r matrix plus a scaled identity matrix. (2) By virtue of this, an efficient algorithm over singular graphs, Sig-SR, is proposed for calculating all-pairs SimRank in O(r(n(2) + Kr-2)) time for K iterations. In contrast, the only known matrix-based algorithm that supports singular graphs [2] needs O(r(4)n(2)) time. The experimental results on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of Sig-SR on singular graphs against its baselines.

DE Multilingual Document Classification; Learning from Multiple Views;
   Semi-supervised Learning
AB We investigate the problem of learning document classifiers in a multilingual setting, from collections where labels are only partially available. We address this problem in the framework of multiview learning, where different languages correspond to different views of the same document, combined with semi-supervised learning in order to benefit from unlabeled documents. We rely on two techniques, coregularization and consensus-based self-training, that combine multiview and semi-supervised learning in different ways. Our approach trains different monolingual classifiers on each of the views, such that the classifiers' decisions over a set of unlabeled examples are in agreement as much as possible, and iteratively labels new examples from another unlabeled training set based on a consensus across language-specific classifiers. We derive a boosting-based training algorithm for this task, and analyze the impact of the number of views on the semi-supervised learning results on a multilingual extension of the Reuters RCV1/RCV2 corpus using five different languages. Our experiments show that coregularization and consensus-based self-training are complementary and that their combination is especially effective in the interesting and very common situation where there are few views (languages') and few labeled documents available.

DE Retrieval robustness; Query difficulty estimation; Performance
   prediction
AB Many information retrieval (IR) systems suffer from a radical variance in performance when responding to users' queries. Even for systems that succeed very well on average, the quality of results returned for some of the queries is poor. Thus, it is desirable that IR systems will be able to identify "difficult" queries in order to handle them properly. Understanding why some queries are inherently more difficult than others is essential for ER, and a good answer to this important question will help search engines to reduce the variance in performance, hence better servicing their customer needs.
   The high variability in query performance has driven a new research direction in the IR field on estimating the expected quality of the search results, i.e. the query difficulty, when no relevance feedback is given. Estimating the query difficulty is a significant challenge due to the numerous factors that impact retrieval performance. Many prediction methods have been proposed recently. However, as many researchers observed, the prediction quality of state-of-the-art predictors is still too low to be widely used by IR applications. The low prediction quality is due to the complexity of the task, which involves factors such as query ambiguity, missing content, and vocabulary mismatch.
   The goal of this tutorial is to expose participants to the current research on query performance prediction (also known as query difficulty estimation). Participants will become familiar with states-of-the-art performance prediction methods, and with common evaluation methodologies for prediction quality. We will discuss the reasons that cause search engines to fail for some of the queries, and provide an overview of several approaches for estimating query difficulty. We then describe common methodologies for evaluating the prediction quality of those estimators, and some experiments conducted recently with their prediction quality, as measured over several TREC benchmarks. We will cover a few potential applications that can utilize query difficulty estimators by handling each query individually and selectively based on its estimated difficulty. Finally we will summarize with a discussion on open issues and challenges in the field.

DE Distributed information retrieval; Federated search; Aggregated search;
   Universal search; Vertical search; Metasearch
AB Federated search refers to the brokered retrieval of content from a set of auxiliary retrieval systems instead of from a single, centralized retrieval system. Federated search tasks occur in, for example, digital libraries (where documents from several retrieval systems must be seamlessly merged) or peer-to-peer information retrieval (where documents distributed across a network of local indexes must be retrieved).
   In the context of web search, aggregated search refers to the integration of non-web content (e.g. images, videos, news articles, maps, tweets) into a web search result page. This is in contrast with classic web search where users are presented with a ranked list consisting exclusively of general web documents. As in other federated search situations, the non-web content is often retrieved from auxiliary retrieval systems (e.g. image or video databases, news indexes).
   Although aggregated search can be seen as an instance of federated search, several aspects make aggregated search a unique and compelling research topic. These include large sources of evidence (e.g. click logs) for deciding what non-web items to return, constrained interfaces (e.g. mobile screens), and a very heterogeneous set of available auxiliary resources (e.g. images, videos, maps, news articles). Each of these aspects introduces problems and opportunities not addressed in the federated search literature.
   Aggregated search is an important future research direction for information retrieval. All major search engines now provide aggregated search results. As the number of available auxiliary resources grows, deciding how to effectively surface content from each will become increasingly important.
   The goal of this tutorial is to provide an overview of federated search and aggregated search techniques for an intermediate information retrieval researcher. At the same time, the content will be valuable for practitioners in industry. We will take the audience through the most influential work in these areas and describe how they relate to real world aggregated search systems. We will also list some of the new challenges confronted in aggregated search and discuss directions for future work.

AB We present a simple and effective approach to complement search results for children's web queries with child-oriented multimedia results, such as coloring pages and music sheets. Our approach determines appropriate media types for a query by searching Google's database of frequent queries for co-occurrences of a query's terms (e.g., "dinosaurs") with preselected multimedia terms (e.g., "coloring pages"). We show the effectiveness of this approach through an online user evaluation.

DE Link generation; disambiguation; learning to rank; Wikipedia
AB We focus on the task of target detection in automatic link generation with Wikipedia, i.e., given an N-gram in a snippet of text, find the relevant Wikipedia concepts that explain or provide background knowledge for it. We formulate the task as a ranking problem and investigate the effectiveness of learning to rank approaches and of the features that we use to rank the target concepts for a given N-gram. Our experiments show that learning to rank approaches outperform traditional binary classification approaches. Also, our proposed features are effective both in binary classification and learning to rank settings.

DE Query log analysis; Evaluation
AB Traditional retrieval evaluation uses explicit relevance judgments which are expensive to collect. Relevance assessments inferred from implicit feedback such as click-through data can be collected inexpensively, but may be less reliable. We compare assessments derived from click-through data to another source of implicit feedback that we assume to be highly indicative of relevance: purchase decisions. Evaluating retrieval runs based on a log of an audiovisual archive, we find agreement between system rankings and purchase decisions to be surprisingly high.

AB Having a mechanism to validate the opinions and to identify experts in a forum could help people to favor one opinion against another. To achieve this, some solutions have already been introduced, including social network analysis techniques and reputation modeling. However, neither of these solutions considers the users' knowledge to identify an expert. In this paper, a novel method is proposed which estimates users' knowledge based on the forum itself, and identifies the possible areas of expertise associated with each user.

DE Audio identification; compressed domain; MDCT spectral entropy
   robustness; fragment retrieval
AB Audio identification via fingerprint has been an active research field with wide applications for years. Many technical papers were published and commercial software systems were also employed. However, most of these previously reported methods work on the raw audio format in spite of the fact that nowadays compressed format audio, especially MP3 music, has grown into the dominant way to store on personal computers and transmit on the Internet. It would be interesting if a compressed unknown audio fragment is able to be directly recognized from the database without the fussy and time-consuming decompression-identification-recompression procedure. So far, very few algorithms run directly in the compressed domain for music information retrieval, and most of them take advantage of MDCT coefficients or derived energy type of features. As a first attempt, we propose in this paper utilizing compressed-domain spectral entropy as the audio feature to implement a novel audio fingerprinting algorithm. The compressed songs stored in a music database and the possibly distorted compressed query excerpts are first partially decompressed to obtain the MDCT coefficients as the intermediate result. Then by grouping granules into longer blocks, remapping the MDCT coefficients into 192 new frequency lines to unify the frequency distribution of long and short windows, and defining 9 new subbands which cover the main frequency bandwidth of popular songs in accordance with the scale-factor bands of short windows, we calculate the spectral entropy of all consecutive blocks and come to the final fingerprint sequence by means of magnitude relationship modeling. Experiments show that such fingerprints exhibit strong robustness against various audio signal distortions like recompression, noise interference, echo addition, equalization, band-pass filtering, pitch shifting, and slight time-scale modification etc. For 5s-long query examples which might be severely degraded, an average top-five retrieval precision rate of more than 90% can be obtained in our test data set composed of 1822 popular songs.

AB This tutorial is concerned with a comprehensive introduction to the research area of learning to rank for information retrieval. In the first part of the tutorial, we will introduce three major approaches to learning to rank, i.e., the pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches, analyze the relationship between the loss functions used in these approaches and the widely-used IR evaluation measures, evaluate the performance of these approaches on the LETOR benchmark datasets, and demonstrate how to use these approaches to solve real ranking applications. In the second part of the tutorial, we will discuss some advanced topics regarding learning to rank, such as relational ranking, diverse ranking, semi-supervised ranking, transfer ranking, query-dependent ranking, and training data preprocessing. In the third part, we will briefly mention the recent advances in statistical learning theory for ranking, which explain the generalization ability and statistical consistency of different ranking methods. In the last part, we will conclude the tutorial and show several future research directions.

AB Given a collection of documents, various multi-document summarization methods have been proposed to generate a short summary. However, few studies have been reported on aggregating different summarization methods to possibly generate better summarization results. We propose a weighted consensus summarization method to combine the results from single summarization systems. Experimental results on DUC2004 data sets demonstrate the performance improvement by aggregating multiple summarization systems, and our proposed weighted consensus summarization method outperforms other combination methods.

AB This paper presents a new way of thinking for IR metric optimization. It is argued that the optimal ranking problem should be factorized into two distinct yet interrelated stages: the relevance prediction stage and ranking decision stage. During retrieval the relevance of documents is not known a priori, and the joint probability of relevance is used to measure the uncertainty of documents' relevance in the collection as a whole. The resulting optimization objective function in the latter stage is, thus, the expected value of the IR metric with respect to this probability measure of relevance. Through statistically analyzing the expected values of IR metrics under such uncertainty, we discover and explain some interesting properties of IR metrics that have not been known before. Our analysis and optimization framework do not assume a particular (relevance) retrieval model and metric, making it applicable to many existing IR models and metrics. The experiments on one of resulting applications have demonstrated its significance in adapting to various IR metrics.

DE Information Retrieval; Mixture Language Models; Smoothing; Parameter
   Estimation; Probabilistic Relevance Model
AB Web documents are typically associated with many text streams, including the body, the title and the URL that are determined by the authors, and the anchor text or search queries used by others to refer to the documents. Through a systematic large scale analysis on their cross entropy, we show that these text streams appear to be composed in different language styles, and hence warrant respective language models to properly describe their properties. We propose a language modeling approach to Web document retrieval in which each document is characterized by a mixture model with components corresponding to the various text streams associated with the document. Immediate issues for such a mixture model arise as all the text streams are not always present for the documents, and they do not share the same lexicon, making it challenging to properly combine the statistics from the mixture components. To address. these issues, we introduce an "open-vocabulary" smoothing technique so that all the component language models have the same cardinality and their scores can simply be linearly combined. To ensure that the approach can cope with Web scale applications, the model training algorithm is designed to require no labeled data and can be fully automated with few heuristics and no empirical parameter tunings. The evaluation on Web document ranking tasks shows that the component language models indeed have varying degrees of capabilities as predicted by the cross-entropy analysis, and the combined mixture model outperforms the state-of-the-art BM25F based system.

DE Active Learning; Supervised Experimental Design; Text Classification;
   Convex Optimization
AB In recent years, active learning methods based on experimental design achieve state-of-the-art performance in text classification applications. Although these methods can exploit the distribution of unlabeled data and support batch selection, they cannot make use of labeled data which often carry useful information for active learning. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning method for text classification, called supervised experimental design (SED), which seamlessly incorporates label information into experimental design. Experimental results show that SED outperforms its counterparts which either discard the label information even when it is available or fail to exploit the distribution of unlabeled data.

DE Portfolio Theory for IR; Quantum Probability Ranking Principle;
   interdependent document relevance
AB Recently, Portfolio Theory (PT) has been proposed for Information Retrieval. However, under non-trivial conditions PT violates the original Probability Ranking Principle (PRP). In this poster, we shall explore whether PT upholds a different ranking principle based on Quantum Theory, i.e. the Quantum Probability Ranking Principle (QPRP), and examine the relationship between this new model and the new ranking principle. We make a significant contribution to the theoretical development of PT and show that under certain circumstances PT upholds the QPRP, and thus guarantees an optimal ranking according to the QPRP. A practical implication of this finding is that the parameters of PT can be automatically estimated via the QPRP, instead of resorting to extensive parameter tuning.

AB We define and study the process of context transfer in search advertising, which is the transition of a user from the context of Web search to the context of the landing page that follows an ad-click. We conclude that in the vast majority of cases, the user is shown one of three types of pages, which can be accurately distinguished using automatic text classification.

DE Query difficulty; text classification
AB We investigate using topic prediction data, as a summary of document content, to compute measures of search result quality. Unlike existing quality measures such as query clarity that require the entire content of the top-ranked results, class-based statistics can be computed efficiently online, because class information is compact enough to precompute and store in the index. In an empirical study we compare the performance of class-based statistics to their language-model counterparts for predicting two measures: query difficulty and expansion risk. Our findings suggest that using class predictions can offer comparable performance to full language models while reducing computation overhead.

DE user intent inference; search behavior modeling; search sessions
AB Effective search session segmentation-grouping queries according to common task or intent- can be useful for improving relevance, search evaluation, and query suggestion. Previous work has largely attempted to segment search sessions off-line, after the fact. In contrast, we present preliminary investigation of predicting, in real time, whether a user is about to switch interest - that is, whether the user is about to finish the current search and switch to another search task (or stop searching altogether). We explore an approach for this task using client-side user behavior such as clicks, scrolls., and mouse movements, contextualized by the content of the search result pages and previous searches. Our experiments over thousands of real searches show that we can identify context and user behavior patterns that indicate that a user is about to switch to a new search task. These preliminary results can be helpful for more effective query suggestion and personalization.

DE Social Media; Community Question Answering
AB As online Collaborative Question Answering (CQA) services such as Yahoo! Answers and Baidu Knows are attracting users, questions, and answers at an explosive rate, the truly urgent and important questions are increasingly getting lost in the crowd. That is, questions that require immediate responses are pushed out of the way by the trivial but more recently arriving questions. Unlike other questions in collaborative question answering (CQA) for which users might be willing to wait until good answers appear, urgent questions are likely to be of interest to the asker only if answered in the next few minutes or hours. For such questions, late responses are either not useful or are simply not applicable. Unfortunately, current collaborative question-answering systems do not distinguish urgent questions from the rest, and could thus be ineffective for urgent information needs. We explore text- and data-mining methods for automatically identifying urgent questions in the CQA setting. Our results indicate that modeling the question context (i.e., the particular forum/category where the question was posted) can increase classification accuracy compared to the text of the question alone.

DE link analysis; HITS; convergence; rank
AB How many iterations does the (ever more) popular HITS algorithm require to converge in score and, perhaps more importantly, in rank (i.e. to get the nodes of a graph "in the right order")? After pinning down the elusive notion of convergence in rank we provide the first non-trivial bounds on the convergence of HITS. A "worst case" example, requiring a number of iterations superexponential in the size of the target graph to achieve even "mild" convergence, suggests the need for greater caution in the experimental evaluation of the algorithm - as recent results of poor performance (e.g. vs. SALSA) might be due to insufficient iterations, rather than to an intrinsic deficiency of HITS. An almost matching upper bound shows that, as long as one employs exponential acceleration e.g. through a "squaring trick", a polynomial running time (practical in many application domains) always provides strong convergence guarantees.

DE Comment Descriptiveness; Cross-media Retrieval
AB This paper investigates whether Web comments are of descriptive nature, that is, whether the combined text of a set of comments is similar in topic to the commented object. If so, comments may be used in place of the respective object in all kinds of cross-media retrieval tasks. Our experiments reveal that comments on textual objects are indeed descriptive: 10 comments suffice to expect a high similarity between the comments and the commented text; 100-500 comments suffice to replace the commented text in a ranking task, and to measure the contribution of the commenters beyond the commented text.

DE Ad Search; Efficient Query Expansion; Block-based Index; Agglomerative
   Clustering; Ad Rank
AB Online advertising represents a growing part of the revenues of major Internet service providers such as Google and Yahoo. A commonly used strategy is to place advertisements (ads) on the search result pages according to the users' submitted queries. Relevant ads are likely to be clicked by a user and to increase the revenues of both advertisers and publishers. However, bid phrases defined by ad-owners are usually contained in limited number of ads. Directly matching user queries with bid phrases often results in finding few appropriate ads. To address this shortcoming, query expansion is often used to increase the chances to match the ads. Nevertheless, query expansion on top of the traditional inverted index faces efficiency issues such as high time complexity and heavy I/O costs. Moreover, precision cannot always be improved, sometimes even hurt due to the involvement of additional noise.
   In this paper, we propose an efficient ad search solution relying on a block-based index able to tackle the issues associated with query expansion. Our index structure places clusters of similar bid phrases in corresponding blocks with their associated ads. It reduces the number of merge operations significantly during query expansion and allows sequential scans rather than random accesses, saving I/O costs. We adopt flexible block sizes according to the clustering results of bid phrases to further optimize the index structure for efficient ad search. The pre-computation of such clusters is achieved through an agglomerative iterative clustering algorithm. Finally, we adapt the spreading activation mechanism to return the top-k relevant ads, improving search precision. The experimental results of our prototype, AdSearch, show that we can indeed return a larger number of relevant ads without sacrificing execution speed.

DE Pseudo-relevance feedback; True relevance distribution; Irrelevant data;
   Distribution separation model
AB Pseudo relevance feedback (PRF), which has been widely applied in IR, aims to derive a distribution from the top It pseudo relevant documents D. However, these documents are often a mixture of relevant and irrelevant documents. As a result, the derived distribution is actually a mixture model, which has long been limiting the performance of PRF. This is particularly the case when we deal with difficult queries where the truly relevant documents in D are very sparse. In this situation, it is often easier to identify a small number of seed irrelevant documents, which can form a seed irrelevant distribution. Then, a fundamental and challenging problem arises: solely based on the mixed distribution and a seed irrelevance distribution, how to automatically generate an optimal approximation of the true relevance distribution? In this paper, we propose a novel distribution separation model (DSM) to tackle this problem. Theoretical justifications of the proposed algorithm are given. Evaluation results from our extensive simulated experiments on several large scale TREC data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms a well respected PRF Model, the Relevance Model (RM), as well as the use of RM on D with the seed negative documents directly removed.

ID RELEVANCE
AB Most retrieval models estimate the relevance of each document to a query and rank the documents accordingly. However, such an approach ignores the uncertainty associated with the estimates of relevancy. If a high estimate of relevancy also has a high uncertainty, then the document may be very relevant or not relevant at all. Another document may have a slightly lower estimate of relevancy but the corresponding uncertainty may be much less. In such a circumstance, should the retrieval engine risk ranking the first document highest, or should it choose a more conservative (safer) strategy that gives preference to the second document? There is no definitive answer to this question, as it depends on the risk preferences of the user and the information retrieval system. In this paper we present a general framework for modeling uncertainty and introduce an asymmetric loss function with a single parameter that can model the level of risk the system is willing to accept. By adjusting the risk preference parameter, our approach can effectively adapt to users' different retrieval strategies.
   We apply this asymmetric loss function to a language modeling framework and a practical risk-aware document scoring function is obtained. Our experiments on several TREC collections show that our "risk-averse" approach significantly improves the Jelinek-Mercer smoothing language model, and a combination of our "risk-averse" approach and the Jelinek-Mercer smoothing method generally outperforms the Dirichlet smoothing method. Experimental results also show that the "risk-averse" approach, even without smoothing from the collection statistics, performs as well as three commonly-adopted retrieval models, namely, the Jelinek-Mercer and Dirichlet smoothing methods, and BM25 model.

AB With the recent growth of conversational systems and intelligent assistants such as Apple Siri and Google Assistant, mobile devices are becoming even more pervasive in our lives. As a consequence, users are getting engaged with the mobile apps and frequently search for an information need in their apps. However, users cannot search within their apps through their intelligent assistants. This requires a unified mobile search framework that identifies the target app(s) for the user's query, submits the query to the app(s), and presents the results to the user. In this paper, we take the first step forward towards developing unified mobile search. In more detail, we introduce and study the task of target apps selection, which has various potential real-world applications. To this aim, we analyze attributes of search queries as well as user behaviors, while searching with different mobile apps. The analyses are done based on thousands of queries that we collected through crowdsourcing. We finally study the performance of state-of-the-art retrieval models for this task and propose two simple yet effective neural models that significantly outperform the baselines. Our neural approaches are based on learning high-dimensional representations for mobile apps. Our analyses and experiments suggest specific future directions in this research area.

DE relevance patterns; ad-hoc retrieval; neural network
AB Assessing relevance between a query and a document is challenging in ad-hoc retrieval due to its diverse patterns, i.e., a document could be relevant to a query as a whole or partially as long as it provides sufficient information for users' need. Such diverse relevance patterns require an ideal retrieval model to be able to assess relevance in the right granularity adaptively. Unfortunately, most existing retrieval models compute relevance at a single granularity, either document-wide or passage-level, or use fixed combination strategy, restricting their ability in capturing diverse relevance patterns. In this work, we propose a data-driven method to allow relevance signals at different granularities to compete with each other for final relevance assessment. Specifically, we propose a HIerarchical Neural maTching model (HiNT) which consists of two stacked components, namely local matching layer and global decision layer. The local matching layer focuses on producing a set of local relevance signals by modeling the semantic matching between a query and each passage of a document. The global decision layer accumulates local signals into different granularities and allows them to compete with each other to decide the final relevance score. Experimental results demonstrate that our HiNT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art retrieval models significantly on benchmark ad-hoc retrieval datasets.

   Recommendation
AB This work develops a representation learning method for bipartite networks. While existing works have developed various embedding methods for network data, they have primarily focused on homogeneous networks in general and overlooked the special properties of bipartite networks. As such, these methods can be suboptimal for embedding bipartite networks.
   In this paper, we propose a new method named BiNE, short for Bipartite Network Embedding, to learn the vertex representations for bipartite networks. By performing biased random walks purposefully, we generate vertex sequences that can well preserve the long-tail distribution of vertices in the original bipartite network. We then propose a novel optimization framework by accounting for both the explicit relations (i.e., observed links) and implicit relations (i.e., unobserved but transitive links) in learning the vertex representations. We conduct extensive experiments on several real datasets covering the tasks of link prediction (classification), recommendation (personalized ranking), and visualization. Both quantitative results and qualitative analysis verify the effectiveness and rationality of our BiNE method.

AB Multivariate time series forecasting is an important machine learning problem across many domains, including predictions of solar plant energy output, electricity consumption, and traffic jam situation. Temporal data arise in these real-world applications often involves a mixture of long-term and short-term patterns, for which traditional approaches such as Autoregressive models and Gaussian Process may fail. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning framework, namely Long- and Short-term Time-series network (LSTNet), to address this open challenge. LSTNet uses the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to extract short-term local dependency patterns among variables and to discover long-term patterns for time series trends. Furthermore, we leverage traditional autoregressive model to tackle the scale insensitive problem of the neural network model. In our evaluation on real-world data with complex mixtures of repetitive patterns, LSTNet achieved significant performance improvements over that of several state-of-the-art baseline methods. All the data and experiment codes are available online.

AB Ranking question answer pairs has attracted increasing attention recently due to its broad applications such as information retrieval and question answering (QA). Significant progresses have been made by deep neural networks. However, background information and hidden relations beyond the context, which play crucial roles in human text comprehension, have received little attention in recent deep neural networks that achieve the state of the art in ranking QA pairs. In the paper, we propose KABLSTM, a Knowledge-aware Attentive Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, which leverages external knowledge from knowledge graphs (KG) to enrich the representational learning of QA sentences. Specifically, we develop a context-knowledge interactive learning architecture, in which a context-guided attentive convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to integrate knowledge embeddings into sentence representations. Besides, a knowledge-aware attention mechanism is presented to attend interrelations between each segments of QA pairs. KABLSTM is evaluated on two widely-used benchmark QA datasets: WikiQA and TREC QA. Experiment results demonstrate that KABLSTM has robust superiority over competitors and sets state-of-the-art.

AB Personalized context-aware venue suggestion plays a critical role in satisfying the users' needs on location-based social networks (LBSNs). In this paper, we present a set of novel scores to measure the similarity between a user and a candidate venue in a new city. The scores are based on user's history of preferences in other cities as well as user's context. We address the data sparsity problem in venue recommendation with the aid of a proposed approach to predict contextually appropriate places. Furthermore, we show how to incorporate different scores to improve the performance of recommendation. The experimental results of our participation in the TREC 2016 Contextual Suggestion track show that our approach beats state-of-the-art strategies.

AB The EvALL online evaluation service aims to provide a unified evaluation framework for Information Access systems that makes results completely comparable and publicly available for the whole research community. For researchers working on a given test collection, the framework allows to: (i) evaluate results in a way compliant with measurement theory and with state-of-the-art evaluation practices in the field; (ii) quantitatively and qualitatively compare their results with the state of the art; (iii) provide their results as reusable data to the scientific community; (iv) automatically generate evaluation figures and (low-level) interpretation of the results, both as a pdf report and as a latex source. For researchers running a challenge (a comparative evaluation campaign on shared data), the framework helps them to manage, store and evaluate submissions, and to preserve ground truth and system output data for future use by the research community.

   Information Retrieval
AB Modern day social media search and recommender systems require complex query formulation that incorporates both user context and their explicit search queries. Users expect these systems to be fast and provide relevant results to their query and context. With millions of documents to choose from, these systems utilize a multi-pass scoring function to narrow the results and provide the most relevant ones to users. Candidate selection is required to sift through all the documents in the index and select a relevant few to be ranked by subsequent scoring functions. It becomes crucial to narrow down the document set while maintaining relevant ones in resulting set. In this tutorial we survey various candidate selection techniques and deep dive into case studies on a large scale social media platform. In the later half we provide hands-on tutorial where we explore building these candidate selection models on a real world dataset and see how to balance the tradeoff between relevance and latency.

AB Random Forest (RF) is one of the most successful strategies for automated classification tasks. Motivated by the RF success, recently proposed RF-based classification approaches leverage the central RF idea of aggregating a large number of low-correlated trees, which are inherently parallelizable and provide exceptional generalization capabilities. In this context, this work brings several new contributions to this line of research. First, we propose a new RF-based strategy (BERT) that applies the boosting technique in bags of extremely randomized trees. Second, we empirically demonstrate that this new strategy, as well as the recently proposed BROOF and LazyNN_RF classifiers do complement each other, motivating us to stack them to produce an even more effective classifier. Up to our knowledge, this is the first strategy to effectively combine the three main ensemble strategies: stacking, bagging (the cornerstone of RFs) and boosting. Finally, we exploit the efficient and unbiased stacking strategy based on out-of-bag (00B) samples to considerably speedup the very costly training process of the stacking procedure. Our experiments in several datasets covering two high dimensional and noisy domains of topic and sentiment classification provide strong evidence in favor of the benefits of our RF-based solutions. We show that BERT is among the top performers in the vast majority of analyzed cases, while retaining the unique benefits of RF classifiers (explainability, parallelization, easiness of parameterization). We also show that stacking only the recently proposed RF-based classifiers and BERT using our 00B-based strategy is not only significantly faster than recently proposed stacking strategies (up to six times) but also much more effective, with gains up to 21% and 17% on MacroF1 and MicroF1, respectively, over the best base method, and of 5% and 6% over a stacking of traditional methods, performing no worse than a complete stacking of methods at a much lower computational effort.

DE Search satisfaction; evaluation metrics; online evaluation
AB As in most information retrieval (IR) studies, evaluation plays an essential part in Web search research. Both offline and online evaluation metrics are adopted in measuring the performance of search engines. Offline metrics are usually based on relevance judgments of query-document pairs from assessors while online metrics exploit the user behavior data, such as clicks, collected from search engines to compare search algorithms. Although both types of IR evaluation metrics have achieved success, to what extent can they predict user satisfaction still remains under-investigated. To shed light on this research question, we meta-evaluate a series of existing online and offline metrics to study how well they infer actual search user satisfaction in different search scenarios. We find that both types of evaluation metrics significantly correlate with user satisfaction while they reflect satisfaction from different perspectives for different search tasks. Offline metrics better align with user satisfaction in homogeneous search (i.e. ten blue links) whereas online metrics outperform when vertical results are federated. Finally, we also propose to incorporate mouse hover information into existing online evaluation metrics, and empirically show that they better align with search user satisfaction than click-based online metrics.

AB Technology-assisted review ("TAR") systems seek to achieve "total recall"; that is, to approach, as nearly as possible, the ideal of 100% recall and 100% precision, while minimizing human review effort. The literature reports that TAR methods using relevance feedback can achieve considerably greater than the 65% recall and 65% precision reported by Voorhees as the "practical upper bound on retrieval performance... since that is the level at which humans agree with one another" (Variations in Relevance Judgments and the Measurement of Retrieval Effectiveness, 2000). This work argues that in order to build-as well as to, evaluate-TAR systems that approach 100% recall and 100% precision, it is necessary to model human assessment, not as absolute ground truth, but as an indirect indicator of the amorphous property known as "relevance." The choice of model impacts both the evaluation of system effectiveness, as well as the simulation of relevance feedback. Models are presented that better fit available data than the infallible ground-truth model. These models suggest ways to improve TAR-system effectiveness so that hybrid human-computer systems can improve on both the accuracy and efficiency of human review alone. This hypothesis is tested by simulating TAR using two datasets: the TREC 4 AdHoc collection, and a dataset consisting of 401,960 email messages that were manually reviewed and classified by a single individual, Roger, in his official capacity as Senior State Records Archivist. The results using the TREC 4 data show that TAR achieves higher recall and higher precision than the assessments by either of two independent NIST assessors, and blind adjudication of the email dataset, conducted by Roger, more than two years after his original review, shows that he could have achieved the same recall and better precision, while reviewing substantially fewer than 401,960 emails, had he employed TAR in place of exhaustive manual review.

AB We study how to find relevant questions in community forums when the language of the new questions is different from that of the existing questions in the forum. In particular, we explore the Arabic-English language pair. We compare a kernel-based system with a feed-forward neural network in a scenario where a large parallel corpus is available for training a machine translation system, bilingual dictionaries, and cross-language word embeddings. We observe that both approaches degrade the performance of the system when working on the translated text, especially the kernel-based system, which depends heavily on a syntactic kernel. We address this issue using a cross-language tree kernel, which compares the original Arabic tree to the English trees of the related questions. We show that this kernel almost closes the performance gap with respect to the monolingual system. On the neural network side, we use the parallel corpus to train cross-language embeddings, which we then use to represent the Arabic input and the English related questions in the same space. The results also improve to close to those of the monolingual neural network. Overall, the kernel system shows a better performance compared to the neural network in all cases.

DE selective search; resource selection; federated search
AB We present a learning-to-rank approach for resource selection. We develop features for resource ranking and present a training approach that does not require human judgments. Our method is well-suited to environments with a large number of resources such as selective search, is an improvement over the state-of-the-art in resource selection for selective search, and is statistically equivalent to exhaustive search even for recall-oriented metrics such as MAP@1000, an area in which selective search was lacking.

AB In recent years, gathering relevance judgments through non-topic originators has become an increasingly important problem in Information Retrieval. Relevance judgments can be used to measure the effectiveness of a system, and are often needed to build supervised learning models in learning-to-rank retrieval systems. The two most popular approaches to gathering bronze level judgments - where the judge is not the originator of the information need for which relevance is being assessed, and is not a topic expert - is through a controlled user study, or through crowdsourcing. However, judging comes at a cost (in time, and usually money) and the quality of the judgments can vary widely. In this work, we directly compare the reliability of judgments using three different types of bronze assessor groups. Our first group is a controlled Lab group; the second and third are two different crowdsourcing groups, CF-Document where assessors were free to judge any number of documents for a topic, and CF-Topic where judges were required to judge all of the documents from a single topic, in a manner similar to the Lab group. Our study shows that Lab assessors exhibit a higher level of agreement with a set of ground truth judgments than CF-Topic and CF-Document assessors. Inter-rater agreement rates show analogous trends. These finding suggests that in the absence of ground truth data, agreement between assessors can be used to reliably gauge the quality of relevance judgments gathered from secondary assessors, and that controlled user studies are more likely to produce reliable judgments despite being more costly.

DE Formula Retrieval; Operator Tree; Symbol Layout Tree
AB Math-aware search engines need to support formulae in queries. Mathematical expressions are typically represented as trees defining their operational semantics or visual layout. We propose searching both formula representations using a three-layer model. The first layer selects candidates using spectral matching over tree node pairs. The second layer aligns a query with candidates and computes similarity scores based on structural matching. In the third layer, similarity scores are combined using linear regression. The two representations are combined using retrieval in parallel indices and regression over similarity scores. For NTCIR-12 Wikipedia Formula Browsing task relevance rankings, we see each layer increasing ranking quality and improved results when combining representations as measured by Bpref and nDCG scores.

DE POI Popularity Prediction; Hierarchical Structure; Multiple Sources;
   Multi-view Learning
AB Predicting the popularity of Point of Interest (POI) has become increasingly crucial for location-based services, such as POI recommendation. Most of the existing methods can seldom achieve satisfactory performance due to the scarcity of POI's information, which tendentiously confines the recommendation to popular scenic spots, and ignores the unpopular attractions with potentially precious values. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, termed Hierarchical Multi-Clue Fusion (HMCF), for predicting the popularity of POIs. Specifically, we devise an effective hierarchy to comprehensively describe POI by integrating various types of media information (e.g., image and text) from multiple social sources. For each individual POI, we simultaneously inject semantic knowledge as well as multi-clue representative power. We collect a multi-source POI dataset from four widely-used tourism platforms. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of predicting the attractions' popularity as compared to several baselines.

AB Predicting the click-through rate of an advertisement is a critical component of online advertising platforms. In sponsored search, the click-through rate estimates the probability that a displayed advertisement is clicked by a user after she submits a query to the search engine. Commercial search engines typically rely on machine learning models trained with a large number of features to make such predictions. This inevitably requires a lot of engineering efforts to define, compute, and select the appropriate features. In this paper, we propose two novel approaches (one working at character level and the other working at word level) that use deep convolutional neural networks to predict the click-through rate of a query advertisement pair. Specifically, the proposed architectures only consider the textual content appearing in a query-advertisement pair as input, and produce as output a click-through rate prediction. By comparing the character-level model with the word-level model, we show that language representation can be learnt from scratch at character level when trained on enough data. Through extensive experiments using billions of query-advertisement pairs of a popular commercial search engine, we demonstrate that both approaches significantly outperform a baseline model built on well-selected text features and a state-of-the-art word2vec-based approach. Finally, by combining the predictions of the deep models introduced in this study with the prediction of the model in production of the same commercial search engine, we significantly improve the accuracy and the calibration of the click-through rate prediction of the production system.

ID PRESERVING PRIVACY
AB In this paper, we propose a novel k-anonymization scheme to counter deanonymization queries on social networks. With this scheme, all entities are protected by k-anonymization, which means the attackers cannot re-identify a target with confidence higher than 1/k. The proposed scheme minimizes the modification on original networks, and accordingly maximizes the utility preservation of published data while achieving k-anonymization privacy protection. Extensive experiments on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, where the efficacy of the k-anonymized networks is verified with the distributions of pagerank, betweenness, and their Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S)

AB We address the problem of generating query suggestions to support users in completing their underlying tasks (which motivated them to search in the first place). Given an initial query, these query suggestions should provide a coverage of possible subtasks the user Might g for. We propose a probabilistic modeling frames keyphrases Prom multiple sources and generates y suggestions from these keyphrases. Using the test suites of the TREC Tasks track, we evaluate and analyze each component of our model.

AB In the TREC Total Recall Track (2015-2016), participating teams could employ either fully automatic or human-assisted ("semi-automatic") methods to select documents for relevance assessment by a simulated human reviewer. According to the TREC 2016 evaluation, the fully automatic baseline method achieved a recall-precision breakeven ("R-precision") score of 0.71, while the two semi-automatic efforts achieved scores of 0.67 and 0.51. In this work, we investigate the extent to which the observed effectiveness of the different methods may be confounded by chance, by inconsistent adherence to the Track guidelines, by selection bias in the evaluation method, or by discordant relevance assessments. We find no evidence that any of these factors could yield relative effectiveness scores inconsistent with the official TREC 2016 ranking.

AB Influenza-like illness (ILI) estimation from web search data is an important web analytics task. The basic idea is to use the frequencies of queries in web search logs that are correlated with past ILI activity as features when estimating current ILI activity. It has been noted that since influenza is seasonal, this approach can lead to spurious correlations with features/queries that also exhibit seasonality, but have no relationship with ILI. Spurious correlations can, in turn, degrade performance. To address this issue, we propose modeling the seasonal variation in ILI activity and selecting queries that are correlated with the residual of the seasonal model and the observed ILI signal. Experimental results show that re-ranking queries obtained by Google Correlate based on their correlation with the residual strongly favours ILI-related queries.

DE Image collection; food image; recipe
AB In food-related services, image information is as important as text information for users. For example, in recipe search services, users find recipes based not only on text but also images. To promote studies on food images, many datasets have recently been published. However, they have the following three limitations: most of the datasets include only thousands of images, they only take account of images after cooking not during the cooking process, and the images are not linked to any recipes. In this study, we construct the Cookpad Image Dataset, a novel collection of food images taken from Cookpad, the largest recipe search service in the world. The dataset includes more than 1.64 million images after cooking, and it is the largest among existing datasets. Additionally, it includes more than 3.10 million images taken during the cooking process. To the best of our knowledge, there are no datasets that include such images. Furthermore, the dataset is designed to link to an existing recipe corpus and thus, a variety of recipe texts, such as the title, description, ingredients, and process, is available for each image. In this paper, we described our dataset's features in detail and compared it with existing datasets.

AB Every day, social media users sendic ery iaginable topics. we could predict which topics a user will join in the future, it would be easy to determine what topics will become popular and what kinds of users a topic may attract. It also can be of great interest for many applications. In tins study, we investigate the problem of predicting whether a user will join a topic based on his posting history. We introduce a novel deep convolutional neural network with external neural memory and attention mechanism to perform this problem. User's posting history and topics were modeled with an external neural memory architecture. The convolutional neural network based matching methods were used to construct the relations between users and topics. Final decisions were made based on these matching results. To train and evaluate the proposed method, we collected a largescale dataset from Twitter. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method could perti:mn significantly better than other methods. Comparing to the state-of-the-art deep neural networks, our approach achieves a relative improvement of 18.2% in Fl -score and 28.9% in MAPO10.

AB Email has been a dominant form of communication for many years, and email search is an important problem. In contrast to other search setting, such as web search, there have been few studies of user behavior and models of email search success. Research in email search is challenging for many reasons including the personal and private nature of the collection. Third party judges can not look at email search queries or email message content requiring new modeling techniques. In this study, we built an opt-in client application which monitors a user's email search activity and then pops up an in-situ survey when a search session is finished. We then merged the survey data with server-side behavioral logs. This approach allows us to study the relationship between session-level outcome and user behavior, and then build a model to predict success for email search based on behavioral interaction patterns. Our results show that generative models (MarkovChain) of success can predict the session-level success of email search better than baseline heuristics and discriminative models (RandomForest). The success model makes use of email-specific log activities such as reply, forward and move, as well as generic signals such as click with long dwell time. The learned model is highly interpretable, and reusable in that it can be applied to unlabeled interaction logs in the future.

AB Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) algorithms are widely adopted to index similar items in high dimensional space for approximate nearest neighbor search. As the volume of real-world datasets keeps growing, it has become necessary to develop distributed LSH solutions. Implementing a distributed LSH algorithm from scratch requires high development costs, thus most existing solutions are developed on general-purpose platforms such as Hadoop and Spark. However, we argue that these platforms are both hard to use for programming LSH algorithms and ineffcient for LSH computation. We propose LoSHa, a distributed computing framework that reduces the development cost by designing a tailor-made, general programming interface and achieves high effciency by exploring LSH-speciffc system implementation and optimizations. We show that many LSH algorithms can be easily expressed in LoSHa's API. We evaluate LoSHa and also compare with general-purpose platforms on the same LSH algorithms. Our results show that LoSHa's performance can be an order of magnitude faster, while the implementations on LoSHa are even more intuitive and require few lines of code.

DE Test collection; relevance assessment; pooling; shallow judgments
AB Increasing test collection sizes and limited judgment budgets create measurement challenges for IR batch evaluations, challenges that are greater when using deep effectiveness metrics than when using shallow metrics, because of the increased likelihood that unjudged documents will be encountered. Here we study the problem of metric score adjustment, with the goal of accurately estimating system performance when using deep metrics and limited judgment sets, assuming that dynamic score adjustment is required per topic due to the variability in the number of relevant documents. We seek to induce system orderings that are as close as is possible to the orderings that would arise if full judgments were available.
   Starting with depth-based pooling, and no prior knowledge of sampling probabilities, the first phase of our two-stage process computes a background gain for each document based on rank-level statistics. The second stage then accounts for the distributional variance of relevant documents. We also exploit the frequency statistics of pooled relevant documents in order to determine a threshold for dynamically determining the set of topics to be adjusted. Taken together, our results show that: (i) better score estimates can be achieved when compared to previous work; (ii) by setting a global threshold, we are able to adapt our methods to different collections; and (iii) the proposed estimation methods reliably approximate the system orderings achieved when many more relevance judgments are available. We also consider pools generated by a two-strata sampling approach.

DE Multiple Additive Regression Trees; Dropout; Pruning
AB In this paper we propose X-DART, a new Learning to Rank algorithm focusing on the training of robust and compact ranking models. Motivated from the observation that the last trees of MART models impact the prediction of only a few instances of the training set, we borrow from the DART algorithm the dropout strategy consisting in temporarily dropping some of the trees from the ensemble while new weak learners are trained. However, differently from this algorithm we drop permanently these trees on the basis of smart choices driven by accuracy measured on the validation set. Experiments conducted on publicly available datasets shows that X-DART outperforms DART in training models providing the same effectiveness by employing up to 40% less trees.

DE Usefulness; User Behavior Analysis; Evaluation
AB Usefulness judgment measures the user-perceived amount of useful information for the search task in the current search context. Understanding and predicting usefulness judgment are crucial for developing user-centric evaluation methods and providing contextualize results according to the search context. With a dataset collected in a laboratory user study, we systematically investigate the effects of a variety of content, context, and behavior factors on usefulness judgments and find that while user behavior factors are most important in determining usefulness judgments, content and context factors also have significant effects on it. We further adopt these factors as features to build prediction models for usefulness judgments. An AUC score of 0.909 in binary usefulness classification and a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.694 in usefulness regression demonstrate the effectiveness of our models. Our study sheds light on the understanding of the dynamics of the user-perceived usefulness of documents in a search session and provides implications for the evaluation and design of Web search engines.

DE Community Question Answering; Goodness polarity lexicons; Sentiment
   Analysis
AB We transfer a key idea from the field of sentiment analysis to a new domain: community question answering (cQA). The cQA task we are interested in is the following: given a question and a thread of comments, we want to re-rank the comments, so that the ones that are good answers to the question would be ranked higher than the bad ones. We notice that good vs. bad comments use specific vocabulary and that one can often predict the goodness/badness of a comment even ignoring the question, based on the comment contents only. This leads us to the idea to build a good/bad polarity lexicon as an analogy to the positive/negative sentiment polarity lexicons, commonly used in sentiment analysis. In particular, we use pointwise mutual information in order to build largescale goodness polarity lexicons in a semi-supervised manner starting with a small number of initial seeds. The evaluation results show an improvement of 0.7 MAP points absolute over a very strong baseline, and state-of-the art performance on SemEval-2016 Task 3.

AB We demonstrate a video captioning bot, named Seeing Bot, which can generate a natural language description about what it is seeing in near real time. Specifically, given a live streaming video, Seeing Bot runs two pre-learned and complementary captioning modules in parallel one for generating image-level caption for each sampled frame, and the other for generating video-level caption for each sampled video clip. In particular, both the image and video captioning modules are boosted by incorporating semantic attributes which can enrich the generated descriptions, leading to human-level caption generation. A visual-semantic embedding model is then exploited to rank and select the final caption from the two parallel modules by considering the semantic relevance between video content and the generated captions. The Seeing Bot finally converts the generated description to speech and sends the speech to an end user via an earphone. Our demonstration is conducted on any videos in the wild and supports live video captioning.

AB Query auto-completion (QAC) systems suggest queries that complete a user's text as the user types each character. Such queries are typically selected among previously stored queries, based on specific attributes such as popularity. However, queries cannot be suggested if a user's text does not match any queries in the storage. In order to suggest queries for previously unseen text, we propose a neural language model that learns how to generate a query from a starting text, a prefix. Specifically, we employ a recurrent neural network to handle prefixes in variable length. We perform the first neural language model experiments for QAC, and we evaluate the proposed methods with a public data set. Empirical results show that the proposed methods are as effective as traditional methods for previously seen queries and are superior to the state-of-the-art QAC method for previously unseen queries.

AB In recent years, neural networks have been applied to many text processing problems. One example is learning a similarity function between pairs of text, which has applications to paraphrase extraction, plagiarism detection, question answering, and ad hoc retrieval. Within the information retrieval community, the convolutional neural network model proposed by Severyn and Moschitti in a SIGIR 2015 paper has gained prominence. This paper focuses on the problem of answer selection for question answering: we attempt to replicate the results of Severyn and Moschitti using their open-source code as well as to reproduce their results via a de novo (i.e., from scratch) implementation using a completely different deep learning toolkit. Our de novo implementation is instructive in ascertaining whether reported results generalize across toolkits, each of which have their idiosyncrasies. We were able to successfully replicate and reproduce the reported results of Severyn and Moschitti, albeit with minor differences in effectiveness, but affirming the overall design of their model. Additional ablation experiments break down the components of the model to show their contributions to overall effectiveness. Interestingly, we find that removing one component actually increases effectiveness and that a simplified model with only four word overlap features performs surprisingly well, even better than convolution feature maps alone.

DE Word embedding; term relatedness; global context; word2vec; LSI
AB Exploitation of term relatedness provided by word embedding has gained considerable attention in recent IR literature. However, an emerging question is whether this sort of relatedness fits to the needs of IR with respect to retrieval effectiveness. While we observe a high potential of word embedding as a resource for related terms, the incidence of several cases of topic shifting deteriorates the final performance of the applied retrieval models. To address this issue, we revisit the use of global context (i.e. the term co-occurrence in documents) to measure the term relatedness. We hypothesize that in order to avoid topic shifting among the terms with high word embedding similarity, they should often share similar global contexts as well. We therefore study the effectiveness of post filtering of related terms by various global context relatedness measures. Experimental results show significant improvements in two out of three test collections, and support our initial hypothesis regarding the importance of considering global context in retrieval.

AB Real-time push notification systems monitor continuous document streams such as social media posts and alert users to relevant content directly on their mobile devices. We describe a user study of such systems in the context of the TREC 2016 Real-Time Summarization Track, where system updates are immediately delivered as push notifications to the mobile devices of a cohort of users. Our study represents, to our knowledge, the first deployment of an interleaved evaluation framework for prospective information needs, and also provides an opportunity to examine user behavior in a realistic setting. Results of our online in-situ evaluation are correlated against the results a more traditional post-hoc batch evaluation. We observe substantial correlations between many online and batch evaluation metrics, especially for those that share the same basic design (e.g., are utility-based). For some metrics, we observe little correlation, but are able to identify the volume of messages that a system pushes as one major source of differences.

AB We address the problem of query performance prediction (QPP) using reference lists. To date, no previous QPP method has been fully successful in generating and utilizing several pseudo-effective and pseudo-ineffective reference lists. In this work, we try to fill the gaps. We first propose a novel unsupervised approach for generating and selecting both types of reference lists using query perturbation and statistical inference. We then propose an enhanced QPP approach that utilizes both types of selected reference lists.

AB The increase of voice-based interaction has changed the way people seek information, making search more conversational. Development of effective conversational approaches to search requires better understanding of how people express information needs in dialogue. This paper describes the creation and examination of over 32K spoken utterances collected during 34 hours of collaborative search tasks. The contribution of this work is three-fold. First, we propose a model of conversational information needs (CINs) based on a synthesis of relevant theories in Information Seeking and Retrieval. Second, we show several behavioural patterns of CINs based on the proposed model. Third, we identify effective feature groups that may be useful for detecting CINs categories from conversations. This paper concludes with a discussion of how these findings can facilitate advance of conversational search applications.

DE Collection; E-advertising; Implicit feedback; Recommender systems
AB In this paper, we describe a novel, publicly available collection for recommendation systems that records the behavior of customers of the European leader in eCommerce advertising, Kelkool, during one month. This dataset gathers implicit feedback, in form of clicks, of users that have interacted with over 56 million offers displayed by Kelkoo, along with a rich set of contextual features regarding both customers and offers. In conjunction with a detailed description of the dataset, we show the performance of six state-of-the-art recommender models and raise some questions on how to encompass the existing contextual information in the system.

ID SIMILARITY
AB Many learning-to-rank (LtR) algorithms focus on query-independent model, in which query and document do not lie in the same feature space, and the rankers rely on the feature ensemble about query document pair instead of the similarity between query instance and documents. However, existing algorithms do not consider local structures in query-document feature space, and are fragile to irrelevant noise features. In this paper, we propose a novel Riemannian metric learning algorithm to capture the local structures and develop a robust LtR algorithm. First, we design a concept called ideal candidate document to introduce metric learning algorithm to query-independent model. Previous metric learning algorithms aiming to find an optimal metric space are only suitable for query dependent model, in which query instance and documents belong to the same feature space and the similarity is directly computed from the metric space. Then we extend the new and extremely fast global Geometric Mean Metric Learning (GMML) algorithm to develop a localized GMML, namely L-GMML. Based on the combination of local learned metrics, we employ the popular Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) scorer and Weighted Approximate Rank Pairwise (WARP) loss to optimize the ideal candidate document for each query candidate set. Finally, we can quickly evaluate all candidates via the similarity between the ideal candidate document and other candidates. By leveraging the ability of metric learning algorithms to describe the complex structural information, our approach gives us a principled and efficient way to perform LtR tasks. The experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed L-GMML algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art metric learning to rank methods and the stylish query-independent LtR algorithms regarding accuracy and computational efficiency.

DE learning to rank; Markov decision process
AB One of the central issues in learning to rank for information retrieval is to develop algorithms that construct ranking models by directly optimizing evaluation measures such as normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG). Existing methods usually focus on optimizing a specific evaluation measure calculated at a fixed position, e.g., NDCG calculated at a fixed position K. In information retrieval the evaluation measures, including the widely used NDCG and P@K, are usually designed to evaluate the document ranking at all of the ranking positions, which provide much richer information than only measuring the document ranking at a single position. Thus, it is interesting to ask if we can devise an algorithm that has the ability of leveraging the measures calculated at all of the ranking postilions, for learning a better ranking model. In this paper, we propose a novel learning to rank model on the basis of Markov decision process (MDP), referred to as MDPRank. In the learning phase of MDPRank, the construction of a document ranking is considered as a sequential decision making, each corresponds to an action of selecting a document for the corresponding position. The policy gradient algorithm of REINFORCE is adopted to train the model parameters. The evaluation measures calculated at every ranking positions are utilized as the immediate rewards to the corresponding actions, which guide the learning algorithm to adjust the model parameters so that the measure is optimized. Experimental results on LETOR benchmark datasets showed that MDPRank can outperform the state-of-the-art baselines.

AB As online video service continues to grow in popularity, video content providers compete hard for more eyeball engagement. Some users visit multiple video sites to enjoy videos of their interest while some visit exclusively one site. However, due to the isolation of data, mining and exploiting user behaviors in multiple video websites remain unexplored so far. In this work, we try to model user preferences in six popular video websites with user viewing records obtained from a large ISP in China. The empirical study shows that users exhibit both consistent cross-site interests as well as site-specific interests. To represent this dichotomous pattern of user preferences, we propose a generative model of Multi-site Probabilistic Factorization (MPF) to capture both the cross-site as well as site-specific preferences. Besides, we discuss the design principle of our model by analyzing the sources of the observed site-specific user preferences, namely, site peculiarity and data sparsity. Through conducting extensive recommendation validation, we show that our MPF model achieves the best results compared to several other state-of-the-art factorization models with significant improvements of F-measure by 12.96%, 8.24% and 6.88%, respectively. Our findings provide insights on the value of integrating user data from multiple sites, which stimulates collaboration between video service providers.

AB Software toolkits play an essential role in information retrieval research. Most open-source toolkits developed by academics are designed to facilitate the evaluation of retrieval models over standard test collections. Efforts are generally directed toward better ranking and less attention is usually given to scalability and other operational considerations. On the other hand, Lucene has become the de facto platform in industry for building search applications (outside a small number of companies that deploy custom infrastructure). Compared to academic IR toolkits, Lucene can handle heterogeneous web collections at scale, but lacks systematic support for evaluation over standard test collections. This paper introduces Anserini, a new information retrieval toolkit that aims to provide the best of both worlds, to better align information retrieval practice and research. Anserini provides wrappers and extensions on top of core Lucene libraries that allow researchers to use more intuitive APIs to accomplish common research tasks. Our initial efforts have focused on three functionalities: scalable, multi-threaded inverted indexing to handle modern web-scale collections, streamlined IR evaluation for ad hoc retrieval on standard test collections, and an extensible architecture for multi-stage ranking. Anserini ships with support for many TREC test collections, providing a convenient way to replicate competitive baselines right out of the box. Experiments verify that our system is both efficient and effective, providing a solid foundation to support future research.

DE Reading List; Relevance Embedding; Quality Embedding; Timeliness
   Embedding; Diversity Embedding
AB During every summer holidays, several editions of reading lists are recommended and emerged on mass media, e.g., New York Times, and BBC. However, these reading lists are built for whole people with general topics for some purposes. What if we expect the books of a specific topic at a specific moment? How to generate the requested reading list for our own automatically? In this paper, we propose a searching framework for building a topical reading list anytime, where the Relevance (between topics and books), Quality (of books), Timeliness (of popularities) and Diversity (of results) are embedded into vector representations respectively based on user-generated contents and statistics on social media. We collected 8,197 real-world topics from 198 diverse groups on Librarything. com. The proposed methods are evaluated on the topic collection and the public benchmarks Social Book Search 2012-2016 (SBS). Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our framework.

DE Benefit and Cost; Evaluation Metrics; User Model
ID PROBABILITY RANKING PRINCIPLE
AB The design of a Web search evaluation metric is closely related with how the user's interaction process is modeled. Each behavioral model results in a different metric used to evaluate search performance. In these models and the user behavior assumptions behind them, when a user ends a search session is one of the prime concerns because it is highly related to both benefit and cost estimation. Existing metric design usually adopts some simplified criteria to decide the stopping time point: (1) upper limit for benefit (e.g. RR, AP); (2) upper limit for cost (e.g. Precision@N, DCG@N). However, in many practical search sessions (e.g. exploratory search), the stopping criterion is more complex than the simplified case. Analyzing benefit and cost of actual users' search sessions, we find that the stopping criteria vary with search tasks and are usually combination effects of both benefit and cost factors. Inspired by a popular computer game named Bejeweled, we propose a Bejeweled Player Model (BPM) to simulate users' search interaction processes and evaluate their search performances. In the BPM, a user stops when he/she either has found sufficient useful information or has no more patience to continue. Given this assumption, a new evaluation framework based on upper limits (either fixed or changeable as search proceeds) for both benefit and cost is proposed. We show how to derive a new metric from the framework and demonstrate that it can be adopted to revise traditional metrics like Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG), Expected Reciprocal Rank (ERR) and Average Precision (AP). To show effectiveness of the proposed framework, we compare it with a number of existing metrics in terms of correlation between user satisfaction and the metrics based on a dataset that collects users' explicit satisfaction feedbacks and assessors' relevance judgements. Experiment results show that the framework is better correlated with user satisfaction feedbacks.

AB We propose a heuristic called "one answer per document" for automatically extracting high -quality negative examples for answer selection in question answering. Starting with a collection of question answer pairs from the popular TrecQA dataset, we identify the original documents from which the answers were drawn. Sentences from these source documents that contain query terms (aside from the answers) are selected as negative examples. Training on the original data plus these negative examples yields improvements in effectiveness by a margin that is comparable to successive recent publications on this dataset. Our technique is completely unsupervised, which means that the gains come essentially for free. We confirm that the improvements can be directly attributed to our heuristic, as other approaches to extracting comparable amounts of training data are not effective. Beyond the empirical validation of this heuristic, we also share our improved TrecQA dataset with the community to support further work in answer selection.

DE Knowledge Graph; Entity Set Expansion; Entity Search
AB The entity set expansion problem is to expand a small set of seed entities to a more complete set of similar entities. It can be applied in applications such as web search, item recommendation and query expansion. Traditionally, people solve this problem by exploiting the co-occurrence of entities within web pages, where latent semantic correlation among seed entities cannot be revealed. We propose a novel approach to solve the problem using knowledge graphs, by considering the deficiency (e.g., incompleteness) of knowledge graphs. We design an effective ranking model based on the semantic features of seeds to retrieve the candidate entities. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that the proposed solution significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.

DE Evaluation; Crowdsourcing; Twitter; Ad-hoc Search
AB Research on event detection in Twitter is often obstructed by the lack of publicly-available evaluation mechanisms such as test collections; this problem is more severe when considering the scarcity of them in languages other than English. In this paper, we present EveTAR, the first publicly-available test collection for event detection in Arabic tweets. The collection includes a crawl of 590M Arabic tweets posted in a month period and covers 66 significant events (in 8 different categories) for which more than 134k relevance judgments were gathered using crowdsourcing with high average inter-annotator agreement (Kappa value of 0.6).
   We demonstrate the usability of the collection by evaluating 3 state-of-the-art event detection algorithms. The collection is also designed to support other retrieval tasks, as we show in our experiments with ad-hoc search systems.

DE Text Mining; Topic Modeling; Unsupervised Learning
AB Probabilistic topic models are generative models that describe the content of documents by discovering the latent topics underlying them. However, the structure of the textual input, and for instance the grouping of words in coherent text spans such as sentences, contains much information which is generally lost with these models. In this paper, we propose sentenceLDA, an extension of LDA whose goal is to overcome this limitation by incorporating the structure of the text in the generative and inference processes. We illustrate the advantages of sentenceLDA by comparing it with LDA using both intrinsic (perplexity) and extrinsic (text classification) evaluation tasks on different text collections.

DE Web search engines; crawling; indexing; query processing; efficiency;
   scalability
AB Commercial web search engines need to process thousands of queries every second and provide responses to user queries within a few hundred milliseconds. As a consequence of these tight performance constraints, search engines construct and maintain very large computing infrastructures for crawling the Web, indexing discovered pages, and processing user queries. The scalability and efficiency of these infrastructures require careful performance optimizations in every major component of the search engine.
   This tutorial aims to provide a fairly comprehensive overview of the scalability and efficiency challenges in large-scale web search engines. In particular, the tutorial provides an in-depth architectural overview of a web search engine, mainly focusing on the web crawling, indexing, and query processing components. The scalability and efficiency issues encountered in these components are presented at four different granularities: at the level of a single computer, a cluster of computers, a single data center, and a multi-center search engine. The tutorial also points out some open research problems and provides recommendations to researchers who are new to the field.

AB Recently Twitter has complemented traditional newswire as a source of valuable Financial information. Although there is a rich body of published research dealing with the task of ranking tweets, there has been little published research dealing with ranking tweets within a Financial context. Here we consider whether popularity factors within Twitter can be used as a signal for popularity within the domain of financial experts. Our results suggest that what interests Finance is not the same as what interests the users of Twitter.

AB Digital traces of conversations in micro-blogging platforms and OSNs provide information about user opinion with a high degree of resolution. These information sources can be exploited to understand and monitor collective behaviors. In this work, we focus on polarization classes, i.e., those topics that require the user to side exclusively with one position. The proposed method provides an iterative classification of users and keywords: first, polarized users are identified, then polarized keywords are discovered by monitoring the activities of previously classified users. This method thus allows tracking users and topics over time. We report several experiments conducted on two Twitter datasets during political election time-frames. We measure the user classification accuracy on a golden set of users, and analyze the relevance of the extracted keywords for the ongoing political discussion.

DE Ordinal Quantification; Quantification; Sentiment Analysis
AB In recent years there has been a growing interest in text quantification, a supervised learning task where the goal is to accurately estimate, in an unlabelled set of items, the prevalence (or "relative frequency") of each class c in a predefined set C. Text quantification has several applications, and is a dominant concern infields such as market research, the social sciences, political science, and epidemiology. In this paper we tackle, for the first time, the problem of ordinal text quantification, defined as the task of performing text quantification when a total order is defined on the set of classes; estimating the prevalence of "five stars" reviews in a set of reviews of a given product, and monitoring this prevalence across time, is an example application. We present OQT, a novel tree-based OQ algorithm, and discuss experimental results obtained on a dataset of tweets classified according to sentiment strength.

DE Significant Words; Language Model
AB Transforming the data into a suitable representation is the first key step of data analysis, and the performance of any data oriented method is heavily depending on it. We study questions on how we can best learn representations for textual entities that are: 1) precise, 2) robust against noisy terms, 3) transferable over time, and 4) interpretable by human inspection. Inspired by the early work of Luhn [4], we propose significant words language models of a set of documents that capture all, and only, the significant shared terms from them. We adjust the weights of common terms that are already well explained by the document collection as well as the weight of incidental rare terms that are only explained by specific documents, which eventually results in having only the significant terms left in the model.

ID TIME; LONG
AB Search result examination is an important part of searching. High page load latency for landing pages (clicked results) can reduce the efficiency of the search process. Proactively prefetching landing pages in advance of clickthrough can save searchers valuable time. However, prefetching consumes resources that are wasted unless the prefetched results are requested by searchers. Balancing the costs in prefetching particular results against the benefits in reduced latency to searchers represents the search result prefetching challenge. We present methods that leverage searchers' cursor movements on search result pages in real time to dynamically estimate the result that searchers will request next. We demonstrate through large-scale log analysis that our approach significantly outperforms three strong baselines that prefetch results based on (i) the search engine result ranking, (ii) past clicks from all searchers for the query, or (iii) past clicks from the current searcher for the query. Our promising findings have implications for the design of search support that makes the search process more efficient.

AB A robust retrieval system ensures that user experience is not damaged by the presence of poorly-performing queries. Such robustness can be measured by risk-sensitive evaluation measures, which assess the extent to which a system performs worse than a given baseline system. However, using a particular, single system as the baseline suffers from the fact that retrieval performance highly varies among IR systems across topics. Thus, a single system would in general fail in providing enough information about the real baseline performance for every topic under consideration, and hence it would in general fail in measuring the real risk associated with any given system. Based upon the Chi-squared statistic, we propose a new measure Z(Risk) that exhibits more promise since it takes into account multiple baselines when measuring risk, and a derivative measure called GeoRisk, which enhances Z(Risk) by also taking into account the overall magnitude of effectiveness. This paper demonstrates the bene fits of Z(Risk) and GeoRisk upon TREC data, and how to exploit GeoRisk for risk-sensitive learning to rank, thereby making use of multiple baselines within the learning objective function to obtain effective yet risk-averse/robust ranking systems. Experiments using 10,000 topics from the MSLR learning to rank dataset demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed Chi-square statistic-based objective function.

DE Query Intent; Children; Search engines
AB The Internet is the biggest data-sharing platform, comprised of an immeasurable quantity of resources covering diverse topics appealing to users of all ages. Children shape tomorrow's society, so it is essential that this audience becomes agile with searching information. Although young users prefer well-known search engines, their lack of skill in formulating adequate queries and the fact that search tools were not designed explicitly with children in mind, can result in poor outcomes. The reasons for this include children's limited vocabulary, which makes it challenging to articulate information needs using short queries, or their tendency to create queries that are too long, which translates to few or irrelevant retrieved results. To enhance web search environments in response to children's behaviors and expectations, in this paper we discuss an initial effort to verify well-known issues, and identify yet to be explored ones, that affect children in formulating (natural language or keyword) queries. We also present a novel search intent module developed in response to these issues, which can seamlessly be integrated with existing search engines favored by children. The proposed module interprets a child's query and creates a shorter and more concise query to submit to a search engine, which can lead to a more successful search session. Initial experiments conducted using a sample of children queries validate the correctness of the proposed search intent module.

DE TEL dataset; Educational Dataset; MOOC; Coursera
AB In the Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) community, the problem of conducting reproducible evaluations of recommender systems is still open, due to the lack of exhaustive benchmarks. The few public datasets available in TEL have limitations, being mostly small and local.
   Recently, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) are attracting many studies in TEL, mainly because of the huge amount of data for these courses and their potential for many applications in TEL. This paper presents DAJEE, a dataset built from the crawling of MOOCs hosted on the Coursera platform. DAJEE offers information on the usage of more than 20,000 resources in 407 courses by 484 instructors, with a conjunction of different educational entities in order to store the courses' structure and the instructors' teaching experiences.

AB Scholars often seek to understand topics discussed on Twitter using topic modelling approaches. Several coherence metrics have been proposed for evaluating the coherence of the topics generated by these approaches, including the pre-calculated Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) of word pairs and the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) word representation vectors. As Twitter data contains abbreviations and a number of peculiarities (e.g. hashtags), it can be challenging to train effective PMI data or LSA word representation. Recently, Word Embedding (WE) has emerged as a particularly effective approach for capturing the similarity among words. Hence, in this paper, we propose new Word Embedding-based topic coherence metrics. To determine the usefulness of these new metrics, we compare them with the previous PMI/LSA-based metrics. We also conduct a large-scale crowdsourced user study to determine whether the new Word Embedding-based metrics better align with human preferences. Using two Twitter datasets, our results show that the WE-based metrics can capture the coherence of topics in tweets more robustly and efficiently than the PMI/LSA-based ones.

DE Implicit system search; virtual assistants
AB Web search functionality is increasingly integrated into operating systems, software applications, and other interactive environments that extend beyond the traditional web browser. In particular, intelligent virtual assistants (e.g., Microsoft Cortana or Apple Siri) often "fall-back" to generic web search in cases where utterances fall outside the set of scenarios known to the agent. In this paper we analyze a 3 month log of web search queries posed via the Cortana virtual assistant. We report that, in this environment, users frequently ask questions that implicitly pertain to the systems or devices from which they are searching (e.g., asking: [how do I take a screenshot]). Unfortunately, accurately answering these implicit system queries poses significant challenges to general web search engines, due in part to the lack of available context. We show that such queries: (1) can be detected with high precision, (2) are common, and (3) can be automatically reformulated to substantially improve retrieval performance in these fall-through scenarios.

AB Recent years have witnessed a proliferation of large-scale knowledge graphs, from purely academic projects such as YAGO to major commercial projects such as Google's Knowledge Graph and Microsoft's Satori. Whereas there is a large body of research on mining homogeneous graphs, this new generation of information networks are highly heterogeneous, with thousands of entity and relation types and billions of instances of those types (graph vertices and edges). In this tutorial, we present the state of the art in constructing, mining, and growing knowledge graphs. The purpose of the tutorial is to equip newcomers to this exciting field with an understanding of the basic concepts, tools and methodologies, open research challenges, as well as pointers to available datasets and relevant literature. Knowledge graphs have become an enabling resource for a plethora of new knowledge-rich applications. Consequently, the tutorial will also discuss the role of knowledge bases in empowering a range of web applications, from web search to social networks to digital assistants. A publicly available knowledge base (Freebase) will be used throughout the tutorial to exemplify the different techniques.

DE Evaluation Metric; Correlation Coefficient
AB One way of evaluating the reusability of a test collection is to determine whether removing the unique contributions of some system would alter the preference order between that system and others. Rank correlation measures such as Kendall's iota are often used for this purpose. Rank correlation measures are appropriate for ordinal measures in which only preference order is important, but many evaluation measures produce system scores in which both the preference order and the magnitude of the score difference are important. Such measures are referred to as interval. Pearson's rho offers one way in which correlation can be computed over results from an interval measure such that smaller errors in the gap size are preferred. When seeking to improve over existing systems, we care the most about comparisons among the best systems. For that purpose we prefer head-weighed measures such as tau(AP), which is designed for ordinal data. No present head weighted measure fully leverages the information present in interval effectiveness measures. This paper introduces such a measure, referred to as Pearson Rank.

ID DICTIONARY LOOK-UP
AB Searching for similar objects in a collection is a core task of many applications in databases, pattern recognition, and information retrieval. As there exist similarity-preserving hash functions like SimHash, indexing these objects reduces to the solution of the Approximate Dictionary Queries problem. In this problem we have to index a collection of fixed-sized keys to efficiently retrieve all the keys which are at a Hamming distance at most k from a query key.
   In this paper we propose new solutions for the approximate dictionary queries problem. These solutions combine the use of succinct data structures with an efficient representation of the keys to significantly reduce the space usage of the state-of-the-art solutions without introducing any time penalty. Finally, by exploiting triangle inequality, we can also significantly speed up the query time of the existing solutions.

AB Many types of search tasks are answered through the computation of a ranked list of suggested answers. We re-examine the usual assumption that answer lists should be as long as possible, and suggest that when the number of matching items is potentially small - perhaps even zero - it may be more helpful to "quit while ahead", that is, to truncate the answer ranking earlier rather than later. To capture this effect, metrics are required which are attuned to the length of the ranking, and can handle cases in which there are no relevant documents. In this work we explore a generalized approach for representing truncated result sets, and propose modifications to a number of popular evaluation metrics.

AB Relational inference is a crucial technique for knowledge base population. The central problem in the study of relational inference is to infer unknown relations between entities from the facts given in the knowledge bases. Two popular models have been put forth recently to solve this problem, which are the latent factor models and the random-walk models, respectively. However, each of them has their pros and cons, depending on their computational efficiency and inference accuracy. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical random-walk inference algorithm for relational learning in large scale graph-structured knowledge bases, which not only maintains the computational simplicity of the random-walk models, but also provides better inference accuracy than related works. The improvements come from two basic assumptions we proposed in this paper. Firstly, we assume that although a relation between two entities is syntactically directional, the information conveyed by this relation is equally shared between the connected entities, thus all of the relations are semantically bidirectional. Secondly, we assume that the topology structures of the relation-specific subgraphs in knowledge bases can be exploited to improve the performance of the random-walk based relational inference algorithms. The proposed algorithm and ideas are validated with numerical results on experimental data sampled from practical knowledge bases, and the results are compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

DE Anomaly detection; music information retrieval; unsupervised
AB This paper presents an unsupervised method for systematically identifying anomalies in music datasets. The model integrates categorical regression and robust estimation techniques to infer anomalous scores in music clips. When applied to a music genre recognition dataset, the new method is able to detect corrupted, distorted, or mislabeled audio samples based on commonly used features in music information retrieval. The evaluation results show that the algorithm outperforms other anomaly detection methods and is capable of finding problematic samples identified by human experts. The proposed method introduces a preliminary framework for anomaly detection in music data that can serve as a useful tool to improve data integrity in the future.

DE Information retrieval; Query difficulty; difficulty understanding
AB Predicting if a query will be difficult for a system is important to improve retrieval effectiveness by implementing specific processing. There have been several attempts to predict difficulty, both automatically and manually; but without high accuracy at a pre-retrieval stage. In this paper, we focus rather on understanding why a query is perceived by humans as difficult. We ran two separated but related experiments in which we asked humans to provide both a query difficulty prediction and reasons to explain their prediction. Results show that: (i) reasons can be categorized into 4 classes; (ii) reasons can be framed into closed questions to be answered on a Likert scale; and (iii) some reasons correlate in a coherent way with the human predicted numerical difficulty. On the basis of these results it is possible to derive hints to be provided to help users when formulating their queries and to avoid them to rely on their wrong perception of difficulty.

DE Game Theory; Crowdsourcing; Relevance Assessment; Chicken Game
AB In this paper we introduce a game scenario for crowdsourcing (CS) using incentives as a bait for careless (gambler) workers, who respond to them in a characteristic way. We hypothesise that careless workers are risk-inclined and can be detected in the game scenario by their use of time, and test this hypothesis in two steps: first, we formulate and prove a theorem stating that a risk-inclined worker will react to competition with shorter Task Completion Time (TCT) than a risk-neutral or risk-averse worker. Second, we check if the game scenario introduces a link between TCT and performance, by performing a crowdsourced evaluation using 35 topics from the TREC-8 collection. Experimental evidence confirms our hypothesis, showing that TCT can be used as a powerful discrimination factor to detect careless workers. This is a valuable result in the quest for quality assurance in CS-based micro tasks such as relevance assessment.

DE Unmatched Terms; Document Ranking; Community-based Question Answering
AB A fundamental task in Information Retrieval (IR) is term weighting. Early IR theory considered both the presence or absence of all terms in the lexicon for ranking and needed to weight them all. Yet, as the size of lexicons grew and models became too complex, common weighting models preferred to aggregate only the weights of the query terms that are matched in candidate documents. Thus, unmatched term contribution in these models is only considered indirectly, such as in probability smoothing with corpus distribution, or in weight normalization by document length. In this work we propose a novel term weighting model that directly assesses the weights of unmatched terms, and show its benefits. Specifically, we propose a Learning To Rank framework, in which features corresponding to matched terms are also "mirrored" in similar features that account only for unmatched terms. The relative importance of each feature is learned via a click-through query log. As a test case, we consider vertical search in Community-based Question Answering (CQA) sites from Web queries. Queries that result in viewing CQA content often contain fine grained information needs and benefit more from unmatched term weighting. We assess our model both via manual evaluation and via automatic evaluation over a clickthrough log. Our results show consistent improvement in retrieval when unmatched information is taken into account. This holds both when only identical terms are considered matched, and when related terms are matched via distributional similarity.

AB Web sites have adopted a variety of adversarial techniques to prevent web crawlers from retrieving their content. While it is possible to simulate users behavior using a browser to crawl such sites, this approach is not scalable. Therefore, understanding existing adversarial techniques is important to design crawling strategies that can adapt to retrieve the content as efficiently as possible. Ideally, a web crawler should detect the nature of the adversarial policies and select the most cost-effective means to defeat them. In this paper, we discuss the results of a large-scale study of web site behavior based on their responses to different user-agents. We issued over 9 million HTTP GET requests to 1.3 million unique web sites from DMOZ using six different user-agents and the TOR network as an anonymous proxy. We observed that web sites do change their responses depending on user-agents and IP addresses. This suggests that probing sites for these features can be an effective means to detect adversarial techniques.

AB We present an assessment platform for gathering online relevance judgments for mobile push notifications that will be deployed in the newly-created TREC 2016 Real-Time Summarization (RTS) track. There is emerging interest in building systems that filter social media streams such as tweets to identify interesting and novel content in real time, putatively for delivery to users' mobile phones. In our evaluation design, all participants subscribe to the Twitter streaming API to identify relevant tweets with respect to a set of interest pro files. As the systems generate results, they are pushed in real time to our evaluation broker via a REST API. The broker then "routes" the tweets to assessors who have installed a custom app on their mobile phones. We detail the design of this platform and discuss a number of challenges that need to be tackled in this type of "Living Labs" setup. It is our goal that such an evaluation design will mitigate any issues that have arisen in traditional batch-style evaluations of this type of task.

DE emotion lexicon; joint NMF; emotion classification
AB In the research of building emotion lexicons, we witness the exploitation of crowd-sourced affective annotation given by readers of online news articles. Such approach ignores the relationship between topics and emotion expressions which are often closely correlated. We build an emotion lexicon by developing a novel joint non-negative matrix factorization model which not only incorporates crowd-annotated emotion labels of articles but also generates the lexicon using the topic-specific matrices obtained from the factorization process. We evaluate our lexicon via emotion classification on both benchmark and built-in-house datasets. Results demonstrate the high-quality of our lexicon.

DE Event extraction; event representation; document indexing; named
   entities; entity linking; summarization; ranking
AB Real world events, such as historic incidents, typically contain both spatial and temporal aspects and involve a specific group of persons. This is reflected in the descriptions of events in textual sources, which contain mentions of named entities and dates. Given a large collection of documents, however, such descriptions may be incomplete in a single document, or spread across multiple documents. In these cases, it is beneficial to leverage partial information about the entities that are involved in an event to extract missing information. In this paper, we introduce the LOAD model for cross-document event extraction in large-scale document collections. The graph-based model relies on co-occurrences of named entities belonging to the classes locations, organizations, actors, and dates and puts them in the context of surrounding terms. As such, the model allows for efficient queries and can be updated incrementally in negligible time to reflect changes to the underlying document collection. We discuss the versatility of this approach for event summarization, the completion of partial event information, and the extraction of descriptions for named entities and dates. We create and provide a LOAD graph for the documents in the English Wikipedia from named entities extracted by state-of-the-art NER tools. Based on an evaluation set of historic data that include summaries of diverse events, we evaluate the resulting graph. We find that the model not only allows for near real-time retrieval of information from the underlying document collection, but also provides a comprehensive framework for browsing and summarizing event data.

AB Push notifications from social media provide a method to keep up-to-date on topics of personal interest. To be effective, notifications must achieve a balance between pushing too much and pushing too little. Push too little and the user misses important updates; push too much and the user is overwhelmed by unwanted information. Using data from the TREC 2015 Microblog track, we explore simple dynamic emission strategies for microblog push notifications. The key to effective notifications lies in establishing and maintaining appropriate thresholds for pushing updates. We explore and evaluate multiple threshold setting strategies, including purely static thresholds, dynamic thresholds without user feedback, and dynamic thresholds with daily feedback. Our best technique takes advantage of daily feedback in a simple yet effective manner, achieving the best known result reported in the literature to date.

AB The proliferation of Internet-enabled devices and services has led to a shifting balance between digital and analogue aspects of our everyday lives. In the face of this development there is a growing demand for the study of privacy hazards, the potential for unique user de-anonymization and information leakage between the various social media profiles many of us maintain. To enable the structured study of such adversarial effects, this paper presents a dedicated dataset of cross-platform social network personas (i.e., the same person has accounts on multiple platforms). The corpus comprises 850 users who generate predominantly English content. Each user object contains the online footprint of the same person in three distinct social networks: Twitter, Instagram and Foursquare. In total, it encompasses over 2.5M tweets, 340k check-ins and 42k Instagram posts. We describe the collection methodology, characteristics of the dataset, and how to obtain it. Finally, we discuss a common use case, cross-platform user identification.

AB Current search engines use very complex ranking functions based on hundreds of features. While such functions return high-quality results, they create efficiency challenges as it is too costly to fully evaluate them on all documents in the union, or even intersection, of the query terms. To address this issue, search engines use a series of cascading rankers, starting with a very simple ranking function and then applying increasingly complex and expensive ranking functions on smaller and smaller sets of candidate results. Researchers have recently started studying several problems within this framework of query processing by cascading rankers; see, e.g., [5, 13, 17, 51].
   We focus on one such problem, the design of the initial cascade. Thus, the goal is to very quickly identify a set of good candidate documents that should be passed to the second and further cascades. Previous work by Asadi and Lin [3, 5] showed that while a top-k computation on either the union or intersection gives good results, a further optimization using a global document ordering based on spam scores leads to a significant reduction in quality. Our contribution is to propose an alternative framework that builds specialized single-term and pairwise index structures, and then during query time selectively accesses these structures based on a cost budget and a set of early termination techniques. Using an end-to-end evaluation with a complex machine-learned ranker, we show that our approach finds candidates about an order of magnitude faster than a conjunctive top-k computation, while essentially matching the quality.

AB In this tutorial, we give the audience a coherent overview of the research of question answering (QA). We first introduce a variety of QA problems proposed by pioneer researchers and briefly describe the early efforts. By contrasting with the current research trend in this domain, the audience can easily comprehend what technical problems remain challenging and what the main breakthroughs and opportunities are during the past half century. For the rest of the tutorial, we select three categories of the QA problems that have recently attracted a great deal of attention in the research community, and present the tasks with the latest technical survey. We conclude the tutorial by discussing the new opportunities and future directions of QA research.

AB The Interface Card model is a promising new theoretical framework for modeling and optimizing interactive retrieval interfaces, but how to systematically instantiate it to solve concrete interface optimization problems remains an open challenge. We propose a novel formulation of the Interface Card model based on sequential decision theory, leading to a general framework for formal modeling of user states and stopping actions. The proposed framework naturally connects optimization of interactive retrieval with Markov Decision Processes and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes, and enables the use of reinforcement learning algorithms for optimizing interactive retrieval interfaces. Simulation and user study experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in automatically adjusting the interface layout in adaptation to inferred user stopping tendencies in addition to user interaction and screen size.

AB Understanding how people interact with information systems when searching is central to the study of Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR). While much of the prior work in this area has either been conceptual, observational or empirical, recently there has been renewed interest in developing mathematical models of information seeking and search. This is because such models can provide a concise and compact representation of search behaviours and naturally generate testable hypotheses about search behaviour.
   This full day tutorial focuses on explaining and building formal models of Information Seeking and Retrieval. The tutorial is structured into four sessions. In the first session we will discuss the rationale of modelling and examine a number of early formal models of search (including early cost models and the Probability Ranking Principle). Then we will examine more contemporary formal models (including Information Foraging Theory, the Interactive Probability Ranking Principle, and Search Economic Theory). The focus will be on the insights and intuitions that we can glean from the math behind these models. The latter sessions will be dedicated to building models that optimise particular objectives which drive how users make decisions, along with a how-to guide on model building, where we will describe different techniques (including analytical, graphical and computational) that can be used to generate hypotheses from such models. In the final session, participants will be challenged to develop a simple model of interaction applying the techniques learnt during the day, before concluding with an overview of challenges and future directions.
   This tutorial is aimed at participants wanting to know more about the various formal models of information seeking, search and retrieval, that have been proposed in the literature. The tutorial will be presented at an introductory level, and is designed to support participants who want to be able to understand and apply such models, as well as to build their own models.

DE Document Classification; Meta-features; Parallelism
AB The unprecedented growth of available data nowadays has stimulated the development of new methods for organizing and extracting useful knowledge from this immense amount of data. Automatic Document Classification (ADC) is one of such methods, that uses machine learning techniques to build models capable of automatically associating documents to well-defined semantic classes. ADC is the basis of many important applications such as language identification, sentiment analysis, recommender systems, spam filtering, among others. Recently, the use of meta-features has been shown to substantially improve the effectiveness of ADC algorithms. In particular, the use of meta-features that make a combined use of local information (through kNN-based features) and global information (through category centroids) has produced promising results. However, the generation of these meta-features is very costly in terms of both, memory consumption and runtime since there is the need to constantly call the kNN algorithm. We take advantage of the current manycore GPU architecture and present a massively parallel version of the kNN algorithm for highly dimensional and sparse datasets (which is the case for ADC). Our experimental results show that we can obtain speedup gains of up to 15x while reducing memory consumption in more than 5000x when compared to a state-of-the-art parallel baseline. This opens up the possibility of applying meta-features based classification in large collections of documents, that would otherwise take too much time or require the use of an expensive computational platform.

AB Reusable test collections allow researchers to rapidly test different algorithms to find the one that works "best". But because of randomness in the topic sample, or in relevance judgments, or in interactions among system components, extreme results can be seen entirely due to chance, particularly when a collection becomes very popular. We argue that the best known published effectiveness on any given collection could be measured as much as 20% higher than its "true" intrinsic effectiveness, and that there are many other systems with lower measured effectiveness that could have substantially higher intrinsic effectiveness.

AB Alerting users about controversial search results can encourage critical literacy, promote healthy civic discourse and counteract the "filter bubble" effect. Additionally, presenting information to the user about the different stances or sides of the debate can help her navigate the landscape of search results. Our existing work made strides in the emerging niche of controversy detection and analysis; we propose further work on automatic stance detection.

DE Ranker evaluation; Learning to rank; Click models
AB We address the problem of how to safely compare rankers for information retrieval. In particular, we consider how to control the risks associated with switching from an existing production ranker to a new candidate ranker. Whereas existing online comparison methods require showing potentially suboptimal result lists to users during the comparison process, which can lead to user frustration and abandonment, our approach only requires user interaction data generated through the natural use of the production ranker. Specifically, we propose a Bayesian approach for (1) comparing the production ranker to candidate rankers and (2) estimating the confidence of this comparison. The comparison of rankers is performed using click model-based information retrieval metrics, while the confidence of the comparison is derived from Bayesian estimates of uncertainty in the underlying click model. These confidence estimates are then used to determine whether a risk-averse decision criterion for switching to the candidate ranker has been satisfied. Experimental results on several learning to rank datasets and on a click log show that the proposed approach outperforms an existing ranker comparison method that does not take uncertainty into account.

AB Creating test collections for modern search tasks is increasingly more challenging due to the growing scale and dynamic nature of content, and need for richer contextualization of the statements of request. To address these issues, the TREC Contextual Suggestion Track explored an open test collection, where participants were allowed to submit any web page as a result for a personalized venue recommendation task. This prompts the question on the reusability of the resulting test collection: How does the open nature affect the pooling process? Can participants reliably evaluate variant runs with the resulting qrels? Can other teams evaluate new runs reliably? In short, does the set of pooled and judged documents effectively produce a post hoc test collection? Our main findings are the following: First, while there is a strongly significant rank correlation, the effect of pooling is notable and results in underestimation of performance, implying the evaluation of non-pooled systems should be done with great care. Second, we extensively analyze impacts of open corpus on the fraction of judged documents, explaining how low recall affects the reusability, and how the personalization and low pooling depth aggravate that problem. Third, we outline a potential solution by deriving a fixed corpus from open web submissions.

DE Corpus; Data Quality; Knowledge Bases; Vandalism
AB We report on the construction of the Wikidata Vandalism Corpus WDVC-2015, the first corpus for vandalism in knowledge bases. Our corpus is based on the entire revision history of Wikidata, the knowledge base underlying Wikipedia. Among Wikidata's 24 million manual revisions, we have identified more than 100,000 cases of vandalism. An in-depth corpus analysis lays the groundwork for research and development on automatic vandalism detection in public knowledge bases. Our analysis shows that 58% of the vandalism revisions can be found in the textual portions of Wikidata, and the remainder in structural content, e.g., subject-predicate-object triples. Moreover, we find that some vandals also target Wikidata content whose manipulation may impact content displayed on Wikipedia, revealing potential vulnerabilities. Given today's importance of knowledge bases for information systems, this shows that public knowledge bases must be used with caution.

AB Recommendation based on user preferences is a common task for e-commerce websites. New recommendation algorithms are often evaluated by offline comparison to baseline algorithms such as recommending random or the most popular items. Here, we investigate how these algorithms themselves perform and compare to the operational production system in large scale online experiments in a real-world application. Specifically, we focus on recommending travel destinations at Booking. com, a major online travel site, to users searching for their preferred vacation activities. To build ranking models we use multi-criteria rating data provided by previous users after their stay at a destination. We implement three methods and compare them to the current baseline in Booking. com: random, most popular, and Naive Bayes. Our general conclusion is that, in an online A/B test with live users, our Naive-Bayes based ranker increased user engagement significantly over the current online system.

   location-based search
AB With mobile devices, web search is no longer limited to specific locations. People conduct search from practically anywhere, including at home, at work, when traveling and when on vacation. How should this influence search tools and web services? In this paper, we argue that information needs are affected by the familiarity of the environment. To formalize this idea, we propose a new contextualization model for activities on the web. The model distinguishes between a search from a familiar place (F-search) and a search from an unfamiliar place (U-search). We formalize the notion of familiarity, and propose a method to identify familiar places. An analysis of a query log of millions of users, demonstrates the differences between search activities in familiar and in unfamiliar locations. Our novel take on search contextualization has the potential to improve web applications, such as query autocompletion and search personalization.

DE Conversion prediction; matrix factorization; temporal dynamic
AB Conversion prediction and click prediction are two important and intertwined problems in display advertising, but existing approaches usually look at them in isolation. In this paper, we aim to predict the conversion response of users by jointly examining the past purchase behavior and the click response behavior. Additionally, we model the temporal dynamics between the click response and purchase activity into a unified framework. In particular, a novel matrix factorization approach named dynamic collective matrix factorization (DCMF) is proposed to address this problem. Our model considers temporal dynamics of post-click conversions and also takes advantages of the side information of users, advertisements, and items. Experiments on a real-world marketing dataset show that our model achieves significant improvements over several baselines.

AB Researchers have focused on finding experts in individual domains, such as emails, forums, question answering, blogs, and microblogs. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for finding experts across these different domains. To do this, we propose an expertise framework that aims at extracting key expertise features and building an unified scoring model based on SVM ranking algorithm. We evaluate our model on a real World dataset and show that it is significantly better than the prior state-of-art.

AB Online Social Networks (OSN) have changed the way information is produced and consumed. Organizing and retrieving unstructured data extracted from these platforms is not an easy task. Galean is a visual and interactive tool that aims to help journalists and historians, among others, analyze news events discussed on Twitter. In this tool, news events are visually represented by the very countries from where the news originated, the date when they happened and their impact in the OSN. Galean considers countries as entities, as opposed to mere geographical locations as most of the tools in the state of the art. As a consequence, it allows users to explore and retrieve news not only by their geographical and temporal context, but also by the relationship among countries. With this tool users can search for behavioral patterns of news events and observe how countries are associated in specific events. We expect our work to become a public tool that helps conduct historical analyses of social media news coverage over time.

DE Text classification; Entity filtering; Active learning; Twitter
AB Monitoring the reputation of entities such as companies or brands in microblog streams (e.g., Twitter) starts by selecting mentions that are related to the entity of interest. Entities are often ambiguous (e.g., "Jaguar" or "Ford") and effective methods for selectively removing non-relevant mentions often use background knowledge obtained from domain experts. Manual annotations by experts, however, are costly. We therefore approach the problem of entity filtering with active learning, thereby reducing the annotation load for experts. To this end, we use a strong passive baseline and analyze different sampling methods for selecting samples for annotation. We find that margin sampling an informative type of sampling that considers the distance to the hyperplane used for class separation can effectively be used for entity filtering and can significantly reduce the cost of annotating initial training data.

DE Learning to rank; recommendation; user-generated content
AB Recently a ranking view of collaborative recommendation has received much attention in recommendation systems. Most of existing ranking approaches are based on pairwise assumption, i.e., everything that has not been selected is of less interest for a user. However it is usually not proper in many cases. To alleviate the limitation of this assumption, in this work, we present a unified framework, named Personalized Semantic Ranking (PSR). PSR models the personalized ranking and the user-generated content (UGC) simultaneously, and the semantic information extracted from UGC can make a remedy for the pairwise assumption. Moreover, utilizing the semantic information, PSR can capture the more subtle information of the user-item interaction and alleviate the overfitting problem caused by insufficient ratings. The learned topics in PSR can also serve as proper explanations for recommendation. Experimental results show that the proposed PSR yields significant improvements over the competitive compared methods on two typical datasets.

However, there have been very limited efforts to connect the two important disciplines. On the other hand, due to lack of mature techniques in privacy-preserving IR, concerns about information privacy and security have become serious obstacles that prevent valuable user data to be used in IR research such as studies on query logs, social media, tweets, and medical record retrieval. We propose this privacy-preserving IR workshop to connect the two disciplines of information retrieval and information privacy and security. We look forward to spurring research that aims to bring together the research fields of IR and privacy/security. Last year, the first privacy-preserving IR workshop focused on mitigating privacy threats in information retrieval by novel algorithms and tools that enable web users to better understand associated privacy risks.

DE timestamping; sub-documents; Web archiving
AB Knowledge about a (Web) document's creation time has been shown to be an important factor in various temporal information retrieval settings. Commonly, it is assumed that such documents were created at a single point in time. While this assumption may hold for news articles and similar document types, it is a clear oversimplification for general Web documents. In this paper, we investigate to what extent (i) this simplifying assumption is violated for a corpus of Web documents, and, (ii) it is possible to accurately estimate the creation time of individual Web documents' components (socalled sub-documents).

DE passage retrieval; question answering; text annotation
AB State-of-the-art question answering (QA) systems employ passage retrieval based on bag-of-words similarity models with respect to a query and a passage. We propose a combination of a traditional bag-of-words similarity model and an annotation similarity model to improve passage ranking. The proposed annotation similarity model is generic enough to process annotations of arbitrary types. Historical fact validation is a subtask to determine whether a given sentence tells us historically correct information, which is important for a QA task on world history. Experimental results show that the combined model gains up to 7.7% and 4.2% improvements in historical fact validation in terms of precision at rank 1 and mean reciprocal rank, respectively.

DE Large-scale classification; Power-law distribution
AB For large-scale category systems, such as Directory Mozilla, which consist of tens of thousand categories, it has been empirically verified in earlier studies that the distribution of documents among categories can be modeled as a power-law distribution. It implies that a significant fraction of categories, referred to as rare categories, have very few documents assigned to them. This characteristic of the data makes it harder for learning algorithms to learn effective decision boundaries which can correctly detect such categories in the test set. In this work, we exploit the distribution of documents among categories to (i) derive an upper bound on the accuracy of any classifier, and (ii) propose a ranking-based algorithm which aims to maximize this upper bound. The empirical evaluation on publicly available large-scale datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves higher accuracy but also much higher coverage of rare categories as compared to state-of-the-art methods.

DE statistical significance; information retrieval
AB The past 20 years have seen a great improvement in the rigor of information retrieval experimentation, due primarily to two factors: high-quality, public, portable test collections such as those produced by TREC (the Text REtrieval Conference [2]), and the increased practice of statistical hypothesis testing to determine whether measured improvements can be ascribed to something other than random chance. Together these create a very useful standard for reviewers, program committees, and journal editors; work in information retrieval (IR) increasingly cannot be published unless it has been evaluated using a well-constructed test collection and shown to produce a statistically significant improvement over a good baseline.
   But, as the saying goes, any tool sharp enough to be useful is also sharp enough to be dangerous. Statistical tests of significance are widely misunderstood. Most researchers treat them as a "black box": evaluation results go in and a p-value comes out. Because significance is such an important factor in determining what research directions to explore and what is published, using p-values obtained without thought can have consequences for everyone doing research in IR. Ioannidis has argued that the main consequence in the biomedical sciences is that most published research findings are false [1]; could that be the case in IR as well?

   Wikipedia
AB Understanding a text, which was written some time ago, can be compared to translating a text from another language. Complete interpretation requires a mapping, in this case, a kind of time-travel translation between present context knowledge and context knowledge at time of text creation. In this paper, we study time-aware re- contextualization, the challenging problem of retrieving concise and complementing information in order to bridge this temporal context gap. We propose an approach based on learning to rank techniques using sentence-level context information extracted from Wikipedia. The employed ranking combines relevance, complementarity and time-awareness. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated by contextualizing articles from a news archive collection using more than 7,000 manually judged relevance pairs. To this end, we show that our approach is able to retrieve a significant number of relevant context information for a given news article.

AB Can the activity patterns of page use during information search sessions discriminate between different types of information seeking tasks? We model sequences of interactions with search result and content pages during information search sessions. Two representations are created: the sequences of page use and a cognitive representation of page interactions. The cognitive representation is based on logged eye movement patterns of textual information acquisition via the reading process. Page sequence actions from task sessions (n=109) in a user study are analyzed. The study tasks differed from one another in basic dimensions of complexity, specificity, level, and the type of information product (intellectual or factual). The results show that differences in task types can be measured at both the level of observations of page type sequences and at the level of cognitive activity on the pages. We discuss the implications for personalization of search systems, measurement of task similarity and the development of user-centered information systems that can support the user's current and expected search intentions.

DE Expertise retrieval; Expertise profiling; Temporal change
AB Personal expertise or interests often evolve over time. Despite much work on expertise retrieval in the recent years, very little work has studied the dynamics of personal expertise. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to characterize how people change or stick with their expertise. Specifically, three factors are taken into consideration in whether an expert will choose a new expertise area: 1) the personality of the expert in exploring new areas; 2) the similarity between the new area and the expert's current areas; 3) the popularity of the new area. These three factors are integrated into a unified generative process. A predictive language model is derived to estimate the distribution of the expert's words in her future publications. In addition, KL divergence is defined on the predictive language model to quantify and forecast the change of expertise. We conduct the experiments on a testbed of academic publications and the initial results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

DE Medical Information Retrieval; Query Analysis; Evaluation Bench-mark
AB We present a post-hoc analysis of a benchmarking activity for information retrieval (IR) in the medical domain to determine if performance for queries with different levels of complexity can be associated with different IR methods or techniques. Our analysis is based on data and runs for Task 3 of the CLEF 2013 eHealth lab, which provided patient queries and a large medical document collection for patient centred medical information retrieval technique development. We categorise the queries based on their complexity, which is defined as the number of medical concepts they contain. We then show how query complexity affects performance of runs submitted to the lab, and provide suggestions for improving retrieval quality for this complex retrieval task and similar IR evaluation tasks.

DE Recipient recommendation; email; generative models
AB We address the task of recipient recommendation for emailing in enterprises. We propose an intuitive and elegant way of modeling the task of recipient recommendation, which uses both the communication graph (i.e., who are most closely connected to the sender) and the content of the email. Additionally, the model can incorporate evidence as prior probabilities. Experiments on two enterprise email collections show that our model achieves very high scores, and that it outperforms two variants that use either the communication graph or the content in isolation.

AB Information retrieval test collections traditionally use a combination of automatic and manual runs to create a pool of documents to be judged. The quality of the final judgments produced for a collection is a product of the variety across each of the runs submitted and the pool depth. In this work, we explore fully automated approaches to generating a pool. By combining a simple voting approach with machine learning from documents retrieved by automatic runs, we are able to identify a large portion of relevant documents that would normally only be found through manual runs. Our initial results are promising and can be extended in future studies to help test collection curators ensure proper judgment coverage is maintained across complete document collections.

DE query-performance prediction; Wikipedia
AB The query-performance prediction task is to estimate retrieval effectiveness with no relevance judgments. Pre-retrieval prediction methods operate prior to retrieval time. Hence, these predictors are often based on analyzing the query and the corpus upon which retrieval is performed. We propose a corpus-independent approach to pre-retrieval prediction which relies on information extracted from Wikipedia. Specifically, we present Wikipedia-based features that can attest to the effectiveness of retrieval performed in response to a query regardless of the corpus upon which search is performed. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the merits of our approach. As a case in point, integrating the Wikipedia-based features with state-of-the-art pre-retrieval predictors that analyze the corpus yields prediction quality that is consistently better than that of using the latter alone.

AB Passage-based retrieval models have been studied for some time and have been shown to have some benefits for document ranking. Finding passages that are not only topically relevant, but are also answers to the users' questions would have a significant impact in applications such as mobile search. To develop models for answer passage retrieval, we need to have appropriate test collections and evaluation measures. Making annotations at the passage level is, however, expensive and can have poor coverage. In this paper, we describe the advantages of document summarization measures for evaluating answer passage retrieval and show that these measures have high correlation with existing measures and human judgments.

DE Log analysis; web search; result list change; search dynamics
AB Although searchers often click on more than one result following a query, little is known about how they interact with search results after their first click. Using large scale query log analysis, we characterize what people do when they return to a result page after having visited an initial result. We find that the initial click provides insight into the searcher's subsequent behavior, with short initial dwell times suggesting more future interaction and later clicks occurring close in rank to the first. Although users think of a search result list as static, when people return to a result list following a click there is the opportunity for the list to change, potentially providing additional relevant content. Such change, however, can be confusing, leading to increased abandonment and slower subsequent clicks. We explore the risks and opportunities of changing search results during use, observing, for example, that when results change above a user's initial click that user is less likely to find new content, whereas changes below correlate with increased subsequent interaction. Our results can be used to improve people's search experience during the course of a single query by seamlessly providing new, more relevant content as the user interacts with a search result page, helping them find what they are looking for without having to issue a new query.

DE Recommender System; Social Network; Social Influence
AB With the rapid expansion of online social networks, social network-based recommendation has become a meaningful and effective way of suggesting new items or activities to users. In this paper, we propose two methods to improve the performance of the state-of-art social network-based recommender system (SNRS), which is based on a probabilistic model. Our first method classifies the correlations between pairs of users' ratings. The other is making the system robust to sparse data, i.e., few immediate friends having few common ratings with the target user. Our experimental study demonstrates that our techniques significantly improve the accuracy of SNRS.

AB Word segmentation is a challenging issue, and the corresponding algorithms can be used in many applications of natural language processing. This paper addresses the problem of Vietnamese word segmentation, proposes a probabilistic ensemble learning (PEL) framework, and designs a novel PEL-based word segmentation (PELWS) algorithm. Supported by the data structure of syllable-syllable frequency index, the PELWS algorithm combines multiple weak segmenters to form a strong segmenter within the PEL framework. The experimental results show that the PELWS algorithm can achieve the state-of-the-art performance in the Vietnamese word segmentation task.

DE Relational Databases; BM25
ID RETRIEVAL
AB We make the suggestion that instead of implementing custom index structures and query evaluation algorithms, IR researchers should simply store document representations in a column-oriented relational database and implement ranking models using SQL. For rapid prototyping, this is particularly advantageous since researchers can explore new scoring functions and features by simply issuing SQL queries, without needing to write imperative code. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by an implementation of conjunctive BM25 using two modern column stores. Experiments on a web collection show that a retrieval engine built in this manner achieves effectiveness and efficiency on par with custom-built retrieval engines, but provides many additional advantages, including cleaner query semantics, a simpler architecture, built-in support for error analysis, and the ability to exploit advances in database technology "for free".

DE Learning to Rank; Label Noise; Robust Data
AB When applying learning to rank algorithms in real search applications, noise in human labeled training data becomes an inevitable problem which will affect the performance of the algorithms. Previous work mainly focused on studying how noise affects ranking algorithms and how to design robust ranking algorithms. In our work, we investigate what inherent characteristics make training data robust to label noise. The motivation of our work comes from an interesting observation that a same ranking algorithm may show very different sensitivities to label noise over different data sets. We thus investigate the underlying reason for this observation based on two typical kinds of learning to rank algorithms (i.e. pairwise and listwise methods) and three different public data sets (i.e. OHSUMED, TD2003 and MSLR-WEB10K). We find that when label noise increases in training data, it is the document pair noise ratio (i.e. pNoise) rather than document noise ratio (i.e. dNoise) that can well explain the performance degradation of a ranking algorithm.

DE Reputation analysis; sentiment lexicons; LDA
AB Reputation analysis is naturally linked to a sentiment analysis task of the targeted entities. This analysis leverages on a sentiment lexicon that includes general sentiment words and domain specific jargon. However, in most cases target entities are themselves part of the sentiment lexicon, creating a loop from which it is difficult to infer an entity reputation. Sometimes, the entity became a reference in the domain and is vastly cited as an example of a highly reputable entity. For example, in the movies domain it is not uncommon to see reviews citing Batman or Anthony Hopkins as esteemed references. In this paper we describe an unsupervised method for performing a simultaneous-analysis of the reputation of multiple named-entities. Our method jointly extracts named entities reputation and a domain specific sentiment lexicon. The objective is two-fold: (1) named-entities are naturally ranked by our method and (2) we can build a reputation graph of the domain's named entities. This framework has immediate applications in terms of visualization or search by reputation.

   Entity Evolution
AB A large number of web queries are related to product entities. Studying evolution of product entities can help analysts understand the change in particular attribute values for these products. However, studying the evolution of a product requires us to be able to link various versions of a product together in a temporal order. While it is easy to temporally link recent versions of products in a few domains manually, solving the problem in general is challenging. The ability to temporally order and link various versions of a single product can also improve product search engines. In this paper, we tackle the problem of finding the previous version (predecessor) of a product entity. Given a repository of product entities, we first parse the product names using a CRF model. After identifying entities corresponding to a single product, we solve the problem of finding the previous version of any given particular version of the product. For the second task, we leverage innovative features with a Naive Bayes classifier. Our methods achieve a precision of similar to 88% in identifying the product version from product entity names, and a precision of similar to 53% in identifying the predecessor.

ID INFORMATION
AB We present a study of the correlation between the extent to which the cluster hypothesis holds, as measured by various tests, and the relative effectiveness of cluster-based retrieval with respect to document-based retrieval. We show that the correlation can be affected by several factors, such as the size of the result list of the most highly ranked documents that is analyzed. We further show that some cluster hypothesis tests are often negatively correlated with one another. Moreover, in several settings, some of the tests are also negatively correlated with the relative effectiveness of cluster-based retrieval.

DE Mathematical Information Retrieval (MIR); Search Engine Results Page
   (SERP); Relevance assessment
AB Finding ways to help users assess relevance when they search using math expressions is critical for making Mathematical Information Retrieval (MIR) systems easier to use. We designed a study where participants completed search tasks involving mathematical expressions using two different summary styles, and measured response time and relevance assessment accuracy. The control summary style used Google's regular hit formatting where expressions are presented as text (e.g. in LATEX), while the second summary style renders the math expressions. Participants were undergraduate and graduate students. Participants in the rendered summary style (n = 19) had on average a 17.18% higher assessment accuracy than those in the non-rendered summary style (n = 19), with no significant difference in response times. Participants in the rendered condition reported having fewer problems reading hits than participants in the control condition. This suggests that users will benefit from search engines that properly render math expressions in their hit summaries.

   Information Retrieval
AB Many national and international heritage institutes realize the importance of archiving the web for future culture heritage. Web archiving is currently performed either by harvesting a national domain, or by crawling a pre-defined list of websites selected by the archiving institution. In either method, crawling results in more information being harvested than just the websites intended for preservation; which could be used to reconstruct impressions of pages that existed on the live web of the crawl date, but would have been lost forever. We present a method to create representations of what we will refer to as a web collection's aura: the web documents that were not included in the archived collection, but are known to have existed - due to their mentions on pages that were included in the archived web collection. To create representations of these unarchived pages, we exploit the information about the unarchived URLs that can be derived from the crawls by combining crawl date distribution, anchor text and link structure. We illustrate empirically that the size of the aura can be substantial: in 2012, the Dutch Web archive contained 12.3M unique pages, while we uncover references to 11.9M additional (unarchived) pages.

DE Search activity attribution; Search personalization
AB Online services rely on machine identifiers to tailor services such as personalized search and advertising to individual users. The assumption made is that each identifier comprises the behavior of a single person. However, shared machine usage is common, and in these cases, the activities of multiple users may be generated under a single identifier, creating a potentially noisy signal for applications such as search personalization. We propose enhancing Web search personalization with methods that can disambiguate among different users of a machine, thus connecting the current query with the appropriate search history. Using logs containing both person and machine identifiers, and logs from a popular commercial search engine, we learn models that accurately assign observed search behaviors to each of different users. This information is then used to augment existing personalization methods that are currently based only on machine identifiers. We show that this new capability to infer users can be used to improve the performance of existing personalization methods. The early findings of our research are promising and have implications for search personalization.

DE Machine translation; cross-lingual retrieval; patent search
AB The statistical machine translation (SMT) component of cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) systems is often regarded as black box that is optimized for translation quality independent from the retrieval task. In recent work [10], SMT has been tuned for retrieval by training a reranker on k-best translations ordered according to their retrieval performance. In this paper we propose a decomposable proxy for retrieval quality that obviates the need for costly intermediate retrieval. Furthermore, we explore the full search space of the SMT decoder by directly optimizing decoder parameters under a retrieval-based objective. Experimental results for patent retrieval show our approach to be a promising alternative to the standard pipeline approach.

DE test collections; reusability; meta-evaluation
AB "Evaluation as a service" (EaaS) is a new methodology that enables community-wide evaluations and the construction of test collections on documents that cannot be distributed. The basic idea is that evaluation organizers provide a service API through which the evaluation task can be completed. However, this concept violates some of the premises of traditional pool-based collection building and thus calls into question the quality of the resulting test collection. In particular, the service API might restrict the diversity of runs that contribute to the pool: this might hamper innovation by researchers and lead to incomplete judgment pools that affect the reusability of the collection. This paper shows that the distinctiveness of the retrieval runs used to construct the first test collection built using EaaS, the TREC 2013 Microblog collection, is not substantially different from that of the TREC-8 ad hoc collection, a high-quality collection built using traditional pooling. Further analysis using the 'leave out uniques' test suggests that pools from the Microblog 2013 collection are less complete than those from TREC-8, although both collections benefit from the presence of distinctive and effective manual runs. Although we cannot yet generalize to all EaaS implementations, our analyses reveal no obvious flaws in the test collection built using the methodology in the TREC 2013 Microblog track.

DE Keyword Co-occurrence Pattern; Geo-tagged; Twitter Stream
AB With the prevalence of the geo-position enabled devices and services, a rapidly growing amount of tweets are associated with geo-tags. Consequently, the real time search on geo-tagged Twitter streams has attracted great attentions. In this paper, we advocate the significance of the co-occurrence of keywords for the geo-tagged tweets data analytics, which is overlooked by existing studies. Particularly, we formally introduce the problem of identifying local frequent keyword co-occurrence patterns over the geo-tagged Twitter streams, namely LFP query. To accommodate the high volume and the rapid updates of the Twitter stream, we develop an inverted KMV sketch (IK sketch for short) structure to capture the co-occurrence of keywords in limited space. Then efficient algorithms are developed based on IK sketch to support LFP queries as well as its variant. The extensive empirical study on real Twitter dataset confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our approaches.

   Reinforcement Learning
AB Dynamic aspects of Information Retrieval (IR), including changes found in data, users and systems, are increasingly being utilized in search engines and information filtering systems. Existing IR techniques are limited in their ability to optimize over changes, learn with minimal computational footprint and be responsive and adaptive. The objective of this tutorial is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to Dynamic Information Retrieval Modeling, the statistical modeling of IR systems that can adapt to change. It will cover techniques ranging from classic relevance feedback to the latest applications of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and a handful of useful algorithms and tools for solving IR problems incorporating dynamics.

DE CQA sites; expert retrieval; test set construction
AB Data retrieved from community question answering (CQA) sites, such as content and users' assessments of content, is commonly used for expertise estimation related tasks. One such task, in which the received votes are directly used as graded relevance assessment values, is ranking replies of a question. Even though these available assessments values are very practical for evaluation purposes, they may not always reflect the correct assessment value of the content, due to the possible temporal or presentation bias introduced by the CQA system during voting process. This paper analyzes a very commonly used CQA data collection in terms of these introduced biases and their effects on the experimental evaluation of approaches. A more bias free test set construction approach, which has correlated results with the manual assessments, is also proposed in this paper.

AB The goal of the proposed tool multi Searcher is to answer this research question: can we expect people to be able to get information from text in languages they can not read or understand? The proposed tool multi Searcher provides users with interactive contextual information that describes the translation in the user's own language so that the user has a certain degree of confidence about the translation. Therefore, the user is considered as an integral part of the retrieval process. The tool provides possibilities to interactively select relevant terms from contextual information in order to improve the translation and thus improve the cross lingual information retrieval (CLIR) process.

AB Given a controversial political topic, our aim is to classify documents debating the topic into pro or con. Our approach extracts topic related terms, pro/con related terms, and pairs of topic related and pro/con related terms and uses them as the basis for constructing a pro query and a con query. Following standard LM techniques, a document is classified as pro or con depending on which of the query likelihoods is higher for the document. Our experiments show that our approach is promising.

DE Performance prediction; Query difficulty; Web search
AB Predicting the performance of web queries is useful for several applications such as automatic query reformulation and automatic spell correction. In the web environment, accurate performance prediction is challenging because measures such as clarity that work well on homogeneous TREC-like collections, are not as effective and are often expensive to compute. We present Rank-time Performance Prediction (RAPP), an effective and efficient approach for online performance prediction on the web. RAPP uses retrieval scores, and aggregates of the rank-time features used by the document-ranking algorithm to train regressors for query performance prediction. On a set of over 12,000 queries sampled from the query logs of a major search engine, RAPP achieves a linear correlation of 0.78 with DCG@5, and 0.52 with NDCG@5. Analysis of prediction accuracy shows that hard queries are easier to identify while easy queries are harder to identify.

DE Sentence Retrieval; Entity Ranking
AB We study the problem. of finding sentences that explain the relationship between a named entity and an ad-hoc query, which we refer to as entity support sentences. This is an important sub-problem of entity ranking which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been addressed before. In this paper we give the first formalization of the problem, how it can be evaluated, and present a full evaluation dataset. We propose several methods to rank these sentences, namely retrieval-based, entity-ranking based and position-based. We found that traditional bag-of-words models perform relatively well when there is a match between an entity and a query in a given sentence, but they fail to find a support sentence for a substantial portion of entities. This can be improved by incorporating small windows of context sentences and ranking them appropriately.

DE information retrieval; evaluation; test collections
AB Search corpora are growing larger and larger: over the last 10 years, the IR research community has moved from the several hundred thousand documents on the TREC disks to the tens of millions of U.S. government web pages of GOV2 to the one billion general-interest web pages in the new ClueWeb09 collection. But traditional means of acquiring relevance judgments and evaluating - e.g. pooling documents to calculate average precision - do not seem to scale well to these new large collections. They require substantially more cost in human assessments for the same reliability in evaluation; if the additional cost goes over the assessing budget, errors in evaluation are inevitable.
   Some alternatives to pooling that support low-cost and reliable evaluation have recently been proposed. A number of them have already been used in TREC and other evaluation forums (TREC Million Query, Legal, Chemical, Web, Relevance Feedback Tracks, CLEF Patent IR, INEX). Evaluation via implicit user feedback (e.g. clicks) and crowdsourcing have also recently gained attention in the community. Thus it is important that the methodologies, the analysis they support, and their strengths and weaknesses are well-understood by the IR community. Furthermore, these approaches can support small research groups attempting to start investigating new tasks on new corpora with relatively low cost. Even groups that do not participate in TREC, CLEF, or other evaluation conferences can benefit from understanding how these methods work, how to use them, and what they mean as they build test collections for tasks they are interested in.
   The goal of this tutorial is to provide attendees with a comprehensive overview of techniques to perform low cost (in terms of judgment effort) evaluation. A number of topics will be covered, including alternatives to pooling, evaluation measures robust to incomplete judgments, evaluating with no relevance judgments, statistical inference of evaluation metrics, inference of relevance judgments, query selection, techniques to test the reliability of the evaluation and reusability of the constructed collections.
   The tutorial should be of interest to a wide range of attendees. Those new to the field will come away with a solid understanding of how low cost evaluation methods can be applied to construct inexpensive test collections and evaluate new IR technology, while those with intermediate knowledge will gain deeper insights and further understand the risks and gains of low cost evaluation. Attendees should have a basic knowledge of the traditional evaluation framework (Cranfield) and metrics (such as average precision and nDCG), along with some basic knowledge on probability theory and statistics. More advanced concepts will be explained during the tutorial.

AB Publication Time (P-time for short) of Web pages is often required in many application areas. In this paper, we address the issue of P-time detection and its application for page rank. We first propose an approach to extract P-time for a page with explicit P-time displayed on its body. We then present a method to infer P-time for a page without P-time. We further introduce a temporal sensitive page rank model using P-time. Experiments demonstrate that our methods outperform the baseline methods significantly.

DE interactive clustering; active clustering; spectral clustering; multiple
   clusterings; disparate clusterings
AB Although it is common practice to produce only a single clustering of a dataset, in many cases text documents can be clustered along different dimensions. Unfortunately, not only do traditional text clustering algorithms fail to produce multiple clusterings of a dataset, the only clustering they produce may not be the one that the user desires. In this paper, we propose a simple active clustering algorithm that is capable of producing multiple clusterings of the same data according to user interest. In comparison to previous work on feedback-oriented clustering, the amount of user feedback required by our algorithm is minimal. In fact, the feedback turns out to be as simple as a cursory look at a list of words. Experimental results are very promising: our system is able to generate clustering:; along the user-specified dimensions with reasonable accuracies on several challenging text classification tasks, thus providing suggestive evidence that our approach is viable.

DE Query Classification
AB The context of the user queries, preceding a given query, is utilized to improve the effectiveness of query classification. Earlier efforts utilize fixed number of preceding queries to derive such context information. We propose and evaluate an approach (DQW) that identifies a set of unambiguous preceding queries in a dynamically determined window to utilize in classifying an ambiguous query. Furthermore, utilizing a relationship-net (R-net) that represents relationships among known categories, we improve the classification effectiveness for those ambiguous queries whose predicted category in this relationship-net is related to the category of a query within the window. Our results indicate that the hybrid approach (DQW+R-net) statistically significantly improves the Conditional Random Field (CRF) query classification approach when static query windowing and hierarchical taxonomy are used (SQW+Tax), in terms of precision (10.8%), recall (13.2%), and F1 measure (11.9%).

DE Automatic System Evaluation
AB In information retrieval (IR), research aiming to reduce the cost of retrieval system evaluations has been conducted along two lines: (i) the evaluation of IR systems with reduced (i.e. incomplete) amounts of manual relevance assessments, and (ii) the fully automatic evaluation of IR systems, thus foregoing the need for manual assessments altogether. The proposed methods in both areas are commonly evaluated by comparing their performance estimates for a set of systems to a ground truth (provided for instance by evaluating the set of systems according to mean average precision). In contrast, in this poster we compare an automatic system evaluation approach directly to two evaluations based on incomplete manual relevance assessments. For the particular case of TREC's Million Query track, we show that the automatic evaluation leads to results which are highly correlated to those achieved by approaches relying on incomplete manual judgments.

AB It is crucial to study basic principles that support adaptive and scalable retrieval functions in large networked environments such as the Web, where information is distributed among dynamic systems. We conducted experiments on decentralized IR operations on various scales of information networks and analyzed effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of various search methods. Results showed network structure, i.e., how distributed systems connect to one another, is crucial for retrieval performance. Relying on partial indexes of distributed systems, some level of network clustering enabled very efficient and effective discovery of relevant information in large scale networks. For a given network clustering level, search time was well explained by a poly-logarithmic relation to network size (i.e., the number of distributed systems), indicating a high scalability potential for searching in a growing information space. In addition, network clustering only involved local self-organization and required no global control clustering time remained roughly constant across the various scales of networks.

The goal of the former theme is to organize clusters into a hierarchy that facilitates browsing and navigation, while the goal of the latter theme is to cluster different types of data simultaneously by making use of the relationship information. Our initial empirical results are promising and they demonstrate that simultaneously attempting both these goals in a single model leads to improvements over models that focus on a single goal.

AB The state-of-the-art in Named Entity Recognition relies on a combination of local features of the text and global knowledge to determine the types of the, recognized entities. This is problematic in some cases, resulting in entities being classified as belonging to the wrong type. We show that using global information about the corpus improves the accuracy of type identification. We explore the notion of a global domain frequency that relates relation-identifying terms with pairs of entity types which are used in that relation. We use this to identify entities whose types are not compatible with the terms they co-occur in the text. Our results on a large corpus of social media content allows the identification of mistyped entities with 70% accuracy.

DE Spam; Email; Filtering; Classification
AB A graph based semi-supervised method for email spam filtering, based on the local and global consistency method, yields low error rates with very few labeled examples. The motivating application of this method is spam filters with access to very few labeled message. For example, during the initial deployment of a spam filter, only a handful of labeled examples are available but unlabeled examples are plentiful. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on TREC 2007 and CEAS 2008 email corpora. Our results compare favorably with the best-known methods, using as few as just two labeled examples: one spam and one non-spam.

DE Dirichlet smoothing; unsupervised approach; parameter estimation
AB A standard approach for determining a Dirichlet smoothing parameter is to choose a value which maximizes a retrieval performance metric using training data consisting of queries and relevance judgments. There are, however, situations where training data does not exist or the queries and relevance judgments do not reflect typical user information needs for the application. We propose an unsupervised approach for estimating a Dirichlet smoothing parameter based on collection statistics. We show empirically that this approach can suggest a plausible Dirichlet smoothing parameter value in cases where relevance judgments cannot be used.

AB Although Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF) techniques improve average retrieval performance at the price of high variance, not much is known about their optimality(1) and the reasons for their instability. In this work, we study more than 800 topics from several test collections including the TREC Robust Track and show that PRF techniques are highly suboptimal, i.e. they do not make the fullest utilization of pseudo-relevant documents and under-perform. A careful selection of expansion terms from the pseudo-relevant document with the help of an oracle can actually improve retrieval performance dramatically (by > 60%). Further, we show that instability in PRF techniques is mainly due to wrong selection of expansion terms from the pseudo-relevant documents. Our findings emphasize the need to revisit the problem of term selection to make a break through in PRF.

DE ranking entity facets; click feedback; GBDT
AB The research described in this paper forms the backbone of a service that enables the faceted search experience of the Yahoo! search engine. We introduce an approach for a machine learned ranking of entity facets based on user click feedback and features extracted from three different ranking sources. The objective of the learned model is to predict the click-through rate on an entity facet. In an empirical evaluation we compare the performance of gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT) against a linear combination of features on two different click feedback models using the raw click-through rate (CTR.), and click over expected clicks (COEC). The results show a significant improvement in ranking performance, in terms of discounted cumulated gain, when ranking entity facets with GBDT trained on the COEC model. Most notably this is true when evaluated against the CTR test set.

AB One reason for semi-supervised clustering fail to deliver satisfactory performance in document clustering is that the transformed optimization problem could have many candidate solutions, but existing methods provide no mechanism to select a suitable one from all those candidates. This paper alleviates this problem by posing the same task as a soft-constrained optimization problem, and introduces the salient degree measure as an information guide to control the searching of an optimal solution. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in the improvement of the performance, especially when the amount of priori domain knowledge is limited.

DE Trails; labels; click graph; anchor text; social bookmarks
AB Search trails comprising queries and Web page views are created as searchers engage in information-seeking activity online. During known-item search (where the objective may be to locate a target Web page), searchers may waste valuable time repeatedly reformulating queries as they attempt to locate an elusive page. Trail shortcuts help users bypass unnecessary queries and get them to their desired destination faster. In this poster we present a comparative oracle study of techniques to shortcut sub-optimal search trails using labels derived from social bookmarking, anchor text, query logs, and a human-computation game. We show that labels can help users reach target pages efficiently, that the label sources perform differently, and that shortcuts are potentially most useful when the target is challenging to find.

DE Quantum Probability Ranking Principle; Interference estimation;
   Diversity
AB The Quantum Probability Ranking Principle (QPRP) has been recently proposed, and accounts for interdependent document relevance when ranking. However, to be instantiated, the QPRP requires a method to approximate the "interference" between two documents. In this poster, we empirically evaluate a number of different methods of approximation on two TREC test collections for subtopic retrieval. it is shown that these approximations can lead to significantly better retrieval performance over the state of the art.

DE spam; email; filtering; classification; noise
AB When trained and evaluated on accurately labeled datasets, online email spam filters are remarkably effective, achieving error rates an order of magnitude better than classifiers in similar applications. But labels acquired from user feedback or third-party adjudication exhibit higher error rates than the best filters - even filters trained using the same source of labels. It is appropriate to use naturally occuring labels - including errors - as training data in evaluating spam filters. Erroneous labels are problematic, however, when used as ground truth to measure filter effectiveness. Any measurement of the filter's error rate will be augmented and perhaps masked by the label error rate. Using two natural sources of labels, we demonstrate automatic and semi-automatic methods that reduce the influence of labeling errors on evaluation, yielding substantially more precise measurements of true filter error rates.

DE Keyword extraction; contextual in-video advertising
AB A key to success to contextual in-video advertising is finding advertising keywords on video contents effectively, but there has been little literature in the area so far. This paper presents some preliminary results of our learning-based system that finds relevant advertising keywords on particular scene of video contents using their scripts. The system is trained with not only features proven useful in earlier studies but novel features that reflect the situation of a targeted scene. Experimental results show that the new features are potentially helpful for enhancing the accuracy of keyword extraction for contextual in-video advertising.

AB There has been a lot of work on evaluating and improving the relevance of web search engines. In this paper, we suggest using human computation games to elicit data from players that can be used to improve search. We describe Page Hunt, a single-player game. The data elicited using Page Hunt has several applications including providing metadata for pages, providing query alterations for use in query refinement, and identifying ranking issues. We describe an experiment with over 340 game players, and highlight some interesting aspects of the data obtained.

DE Entity retrieval; co-reference resolution; term frequency
ID INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; RESOLUTION
AB Text retrieval queries frequently contain named entities. The standard approach of term frequency weighting does not work well when estimating the term frequency of a named entity, since anaphoric expressions (like he, she, the movie, etc) are frequently used to refer to named entities in a document, and the use of anaphoric expressions causes the term frequency of named entities to be underestimated. In this paper, we propose a novel 2-Poisson model to estimate the frequency of anaphoric expressions of a named entity, without explicitly resolving the anaphoric expressions. Our key assumption is that the frequency of anaphoric expressions is distributed over named entities in a document according to the probabilities of whether the document is elite for the named entities. This assumption leads us to formulate our proposed Co-referentially Enhanced Entity Frequency (CEEF). Experimental results on the text collection of TREC Blog Track show that CEEF achieves significant and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art retrieval methods using standard term frequency estimation. In particular, we achieve a 3% increase of MAP over the best performing run of TREC 2008 Blog Track.

AB Traditional bag-of-words information retrieval models use aggregated term statistics to measure the relevance of documents, making it difficult to detect non-relevant documents that contain many query terms by chance or in the wrong context. In-depth document analysis is needed to filter out these deceptive documents. In this paper, we hypothesize that truly relevant documents have relevant sentences in predictable patterns. Our experimental results show that we can successfully identify and exploit these patterns to significantly improve retrieval precision at top ranks.

DE Language Modeling; Topic Modeling; Original Contributions
AB One goal of text mining is to provide readers with automatic methods for quickly finding the key ideas in individual documents and whole corpora. To this effect, we propose a statistically well-founded method for identifying the original ideas that a document contributes to a corpus, focusing on self-referential diachronic corpora such as research publications, blogs, email, and news articles. Our statistical model of passage impact defines (interesting) original content through a combination of impact and novelty, and it can be used to identify the most original passages in a document. Unlike heuristic approaches, this statistical model is extensible and open to analysis. We evaluate the approach on both synthetic and real data, showing that the passage impact model outperforms a heuristic baseline method.

AB In this poster, we develop an evolutionary document summarization system for discovering the changes and differences in each phase of a disaster evolution. Given a collection of document streams describing an event, our system generates a short summary delivering the main development theme of the event by extracting the most representative and discriminative sentences at each phase. Experimental results on the collection of press releases for Hurricane Wilma in 2005 demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal.

Millions of users contribute rich information to Web forum everyday, which has become an important resource for many Web applications, such as product opinion retrieval, social network analysis, and so on. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is that it can not only extract the pure text but also distinguish between the origin post and replies. Experimental results on a large number real Web forums indicate that the proposed algorithm can correctly extract data from websites with various styles in most cases.

AB The need for evaluating large amounts of topics (queries) makes IR evaluation an uneasy task. In this paper, we study a topic selection problem for IR evaluation. The selection criterion is based on the overall difficulty of the chosen set, as well as the uncertainty of the final IR metric applied to the systems. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate that our approach helps to identify a set of topics that provides confident estimates of systems' performance while keeping the requirement of the query difficulty.

DE High-Recall; Electronic Discovery; Systematic Review
AB The goal of high-recall information retrieval (HRIR) is to find all or nearly all relevant documents for a search topic. In this paper, we present the design of our system that affords efficient high-recall retrieval. HRIR systems commonly rely on iterative relevance feedback. Our system uses a state-of-the-art implementation of continuous active learning (CAL), and is designed to allow other feedback systems to be attached with little work. Our system allows users to judge documents as fast as possible with no perceptible interface lag. We also support the integration of a search engine for users who would like to interactively search and judge documents. In addition to detailing the design of our system, we report on user feedback collected as part of a 50 participants user study. While we have found that users find the most relevant documents when we restrict user interaction, a majority of participants prefer having flexibility in user interaction. Our work has implications on how to build effective assessment systems and what features of the system are believed to be useful by users.

DE Evaluation; Search result diversification; Axiomatic analysis
AB Many evaluation metrics have been defined to evaluate the effectiveness ad-hoc retrieval and search result diversification systems. However, it is often unclear which evaluation metric should be used to analyze the performance of retrieval systems given a specific task. Axiomatic analysis is an informative mechanism to understand the fundamentals of metrics and their suitability for particular scenarios. In this paper, we define a constraint-based axiomatic framework to study the suitability of existing metrics in search result diversification scenarios. The analysis informed the definition of Rank-Biased Utility (RBU)- an adaptation of the well-known Rank-Biased Precision metric - that takes into account redundancy and the user effort associated to the inspection of documents in the ranking. Our experiments over standard diversity evaluation campaigns show that the proposed metric captures quality criteria reflected by different metrics, being suitable in the absence of knowledge about particular features of the scenario under study.

AB The unpredictability of user behavior and the need for effectiveness make it difficult to define a suitable research methodology for Information Retrieval (IR). In order to tackle this challenge, we categorize existing IR methodologies along two dimensions: (1) empirical vs. theoretical, and (2) top-down vs. bottom-up. The strengths and drawbacks of the resulting categories are characterized according to 6 desirable aspects. The analysis suggests that different methodologies are complementary and therefore, equally necessary. The categorization of the 167 full papers published in the last SIGIR (2016 and 2017) and ICTIR (2017) conferences suggest that most of existing work is empirical bottom-up, suggesting lack of some desirable aspects. With the hope of improving IR research practice, we propose a general methodology for IR that integrates the strengths of existing research methods.

DE Attribute-aware model; Hierarchical attentive architecture; Next basket
   recommendation
AB Next basket recommendation is a new type of recommendation, which recommends a set of items, or a basket, to the user. Purchase in basket is a common behavior of consumers. Recently, deep neural networks have been applied to model sequential transactions of baskets in next basket recommendation. However, current methods do not track the user's evolving appetite for items explicitly, and they ignore important item attributes such as product category. In this paper, we propose a novel Attribute-aware Neural Attentive Model (ANAM) to address these problems. ANAM adopts an attention mechanism to explicitly model user's evolving appetite for items, and utilizes a hierarchical architecture to incorporate the attribute information. In specific, ANAM utilizes a recurrent neural network to model the user's sequential behavior over time, and relays the user's appetite toward items and their attributes to next basket through attention weights shared across baskets on the two different hierarchies. Experiment results on two public datasets (i.e., Ta-Feng and JingDong) demonstrate the effectiveness of our ANAM model for next basket recommendation.

ID BIASES
AB The use of IR methodology in the evaluation of recommender systems has become common practice in recent years. IR metrics have been found however to be strongly biased towards rewarding algorithms that recommend popular items -the same bias that state of the art recommendation algorithms display. Recent research has confirmed and measured such biases, and proposed methods to avoid them. The fundamental question remains open though whether popularity is really a bias we should avoid or not; whether it could be a useful and reliable signal in recommendation, or it may be unfairly rewarded by the experimental biases. We address this question at a formal level by identifying and modeling the conditions that can determine the answer, in terms of dependencies between key random variables, involving item rating, discovery and relevance. We find conditions that guarantee popularity to be effective or quite the opposite, and for the measured metric values to reflect a true effectiveness, or qualitatively deviate from it. We exemplify and confirm the theoretical findings with empirical results. We build a crowdsourced dataset devoid of the usual biases displayed by common publicly available data, in which we illustrate contradictions between the accuracy that would be measured in a common biased offline experimental setting, and the actual accuracy that can be measured with unbiased observations.

AB We revisit the Probability Ranking Principle in the context of recommender systems. We find a key difference in the retrieval protocol with respect to query-based search, that leads to the identification of different optimal ranking principles for discovery-oriented recommendation. Based on this finding, we revise the effectiveness of common non-personalized ranking functions in respect to the new principles. We run an experiment confirming and illustrating our theoretical analysis, and providing further observations and hints for reflection and future research.

DE Recommender Systems; Group Recommendation; Attention Mechanism; Neural
   Collaborative Filtering; Cold-Start Problem
AB Due to the prevalence of group activities in people's daily life, recommending content to a group of users becomes an important task in many information systems. A fundamental problem in group recommendation is how to aggregate the preferences of group members to infer the decision of a group. Toward this end, we contribute a novel solution, namely AGREE (short for "Attentive Group REcommEndation"), to address the preference aggregation problem by learning the aggregation strategy from data, which is based on the recent developments of attention network and neural collaborative filtering (NCF). Specifically, we adopt an attention mechanism to adapt the representation of a group, and learn the interaction between groups and items from data under the NCF framework. Moreover, since many group recommender systems also have abundant interactions of individual users on items, we further integrate the modeling of user-item interactions into our method. Through this way, we can reinforce the two tasks of recommending items for both groups and users. By experimenting on two real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our AGREE model not only improves the group recommendation performance but also enhances the recommendation for users, especially for cold-start users that have no historical interactions individually.

DE Personalized Recommendation; Recommendation Explanation; Attention
   Distribution
AB Latent Factor Models (LFMs) based on Collaborative Filtering (CF) have been widely applied in many recommendation systems, due to their good performance of prediction accuracy. In addition to users' ratings, auxiliary information such as item features is often used to improve performance, especially when ratings are very sparse. To the best of our knowledge, most existing LFMs integrate different item features in the same way for all users. Nevertheless, the attention on different item attributes varies a lot from user to user. For personalized recommendation, it is valuable to know what feature of an item a user cares most about. Besides, the latent vectors used to represent users or items in LFMs have few explicit meanings, which makes it difficult to explain why an item is recommended to a specific user. In this work, we propose the Attention-driven Factor Model (AFM), which can not only integrate item features driven by users' attention but also help answer this "why". To estimate users' attention distributions on different item features, we propose the Gated Attention Units (GAUs) for AFM. The GAUs make it possible to let the latent factors "talk", by generating user attention distributions from user latent vectors. With users' attention distributions, we can tune the weights of item features for different users. Moreover, users' attention distributions can also serve as explanations for our recommendations. Experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of AFM (using GAUs) over competitive baseline algorithms on rating prediction.

   Collaborative and Adversarial Learning
AB The neural networks have attracted great attention for sentence similarity modeling in recent years. Most neural networks focus on the representation of each sentence, while the common features of a sentence pair are not well studied. In this paper, we propose a Collaborative and Adversarial Network (CAN), which explicitly models the common features between two sentences for enhancing sentence similarity modeling. To be specific, a common feature extractor is presented and embedded into our CAN model, which includes a generator and a discriminator playing a collaborative and adversarial game for common feature extraction. Experiments on three benchmark datasets, namely TREC-QA and WikiQA for answer selection and MSRP for paraphrase identification, show that our proposed model is effective to boost the performance of sentence similarity modeling. In particular, our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on TREC-QA without using any external resources or pre-training. For the other two datasets, our model is also comparable to if not better than the recent neural network approaches.

AB Learning to rank is a key component of modern information retrieval systems. Recently, regression forest models (i.e., random forests, LambdaMART and gradient boosted regression trees) have come to dominate learning to rank systems in practice, as they provide the ability to learn from large scale data while generalizing well to additional test queries. As a result, efficient implementations of these models is a concern in production systems, as evidenced by past work.
   We propose an alternate method for optimizing the execution of learned models: converting these expensive ensembles to a feed-forward neural network. This simple neural architecture is quite efficient to execute: we show that the resulting chain of matrix multiplies is quite efficient while maintaining the effectiveness of the original, more-expensive forest model. Our neural approach has the advantage of being easier to train than any direct neural models, since it can match the previously-learned regression rather than learn to generalize relevance judgments directly.
   We observe CPU document scoring speed improvements of up to 400x over traditional algorithms and up to 10x over state-of-the-art algorithms with no measurable loss in mean average precision. With a GPU available, our algorithm is able to score every document in a batch in parallel for another 10-100x improvement. While we are not the first work to observe that neural networks are efficient as well as being effective, our application of this observation to learning to rank is novel and will have large real-world impact.

AB The past decade has witnessed the emergence of several publicly available and proprietary knowledge graphs (KGs). The depth and breadth of content in these KGs made them not only rich sources of structured knowledge by themselves, but also valuable resources for search systems. A surge of recent developments in entity linking and entity retrieval methods gave rise to a new line of research that aims at utilizing KGs for text-centric retrieval applications. This tutorial is the first to summarize and disseminate the progress in this emerging area to industry practitioners and researchers.

AB Recommendation systems play a vital role to keep users engaged with personalized content in modern online platforms. Deep learning has revolutionized many research fields and there is a recent surge of interest in applying it to collaborative filtering (CF). However, existing methods compose deep learning architectures with the latent factor model ignoring a major class of CF models, neighborhood or memory-based approaches. We propose Collaborative Memory Networks (CMN), a deep architecture to unify the two classes of CF models capitalizing on the strengths of the global structure of latent factor model and local neighborhood-based structure in a nonlinear fashion. Motivated by the success of Memory Networks, we fuse a memory component and neural attention mechanism as the neighborhood component. The associative addressing scheme with the user and item memories in the memory module encodes complex user-item relations coupled with the neural attention mechanism to learn a user-item specific neighborhood. Finally, the output module jointly exploits the neighborhood with the user and item memories to produce the ranking score. Stacking multiple memory modules together yield deeper architectures capturing increasingly complex user-item relations. Furthermore, we show strong connections between CMN components, memory networks and the three classes of CF models. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CMN on three public datasets outperforming competitive baselines. Qualitative visualization of the attention weights provide insight into the model's recommendation process and suggest the presence of higher order interactions.

AB The goal of search result diversification is to select a subset of documents from the candidate set to satisfy as many different subtopics as possible. In general, it is a problem of subset selection and selecting an optimal subset of documents is NP-hard. Existing methods usually formalize the problem as ranking the documents with greedy sequential document selection. At each of the ranking position the document that can provide the largest amount of additional information is selected. It is obvious that the greedy selections inevitably produce suboptimal rankings. In this paper we propose to partially alleviate the problem with a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) enhanced Markov decision process (MDP), referred to as M(2)Div. In M(2)Div, the construction of diverse ranking is formalized as an MDP process where each action corresponds to selecting a document for one ranking position. Given an MDP state which consists of the query, selected documents, and candidates, a recurrent neural network is utilized to produce the policy function for guiding the document selection and the value function for predicting the whole ranking quality. The produced raw policy and value are then strengthened with MCTS through exploring the possible rankings at the subsequent positions, achieving a better search policy for decision-making. Experimental results based on the TREC benchmarks showed that M(2)Div can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines based on greedy sequential document selection, indicating the effectiveness of the exploratory decision-making mechanism in M(2)Div.

AB The phenomenon of trolling has emerged as a widespread form of abuse on news sites, online social networks, and other types of social media. In this paper, we study a particular type of trolling, performed by asking a provocative question on a community question-answering website. By combining user reports with subsequent moderator deletions, we identify a set of over 400,000 troll questions on Yahoo Answers, i.e., questions aimed to inflame, upset, and draw attention from others on the community. This set of troll questions spans a lengthy period of time and a diverse set of topical categories. Our analysis reveals unique characteristics of troll questions when compared to "regular" questions, with regards to their metadata, text, and askers. A classifier built upon these features reaches an accuracy of 85% over a balanced dataset. The answers' text and metadata, reflecting the community's response to the question, are found particularly productive for the classification task.

AB A city is an aggregate of a huge amount of heterogeneous data. However, extracting meaningful values from that data remains challenging. City Brain is an end-to-end system whose goal is to glean irreplaceable values from big city data, specifically from videos, with the assistance of rapidly evolving AI technologies and fast-growing computing capacity. From cognition to optimization, to decision-making, from search to prediction and ultimately, to intervention, City Brain improves the way we manage the city, as well as the way we live in it. In this talk, firstly we will introduce current practices of the City Brain platform in a few cities in China, including what we can do to achieve the goal and make it a reality. Then we will focus on visual search technologies and applications that we can apply on the city data. Last, a few video demos will be shown, followed by highlighting a few future directions of city computing.

AB Existing review-aware recommendation methods represent users (or items) through the concatenation of the reviews written by (or for) them, and depend entirely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract meaningful features for modeling users (or items). However, understanding reviews based only on the raw words of reviews is challenging because of the inherent ambiguity contained in them originated from the users' different tendency in writing. Moreover, it is inefficient in time and memory to model users/items by the concatenation of their associated reviews owing to considerably large inputs to CNNs. In this work, we present a scalable review-aware recommendation method, called Senti Rec, that is guided to incorporate the sentiments of reviews when modeling the users and the items. Senti Rec is a two-step approach composed of the first step that includes the encoding of each review into a fixed-size review vector that is trained to embody the sentiment of the review, followed by the second step that generates recommendations based on the vector-encoded reviews. Through our experiments, we show that Senti Rec not only outperforms the existing review-aware methods, but also drastically reduces the training time and the memory usage. We also conduct a qualitative evaluation on the vector-encoded reviews trained by Senti Rec to demonstrate that the overall sentiments are indeed encoded therein.

AB We examine search engine performance for rank-safe query execution using the WAND and state-of-the-art BMW algorithms. Supported by extensive experiments, we suggest two approaches to improve query performance: initial list thresholds should be used when k values are large, and our split-list WAND approach should be used instead of the normal WAND or BMW approaches. We also recommend that reranking-based distributed systems use smaller k values when selecting the results to return from each partition.

DE Clinical Decision Support; Experimentation; Search; Reproducibility
AB Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems aim to assist clinicians in their daily decision-making related to diagnosis, tests, and treatments of patients by providing relevant evidence from the scientific literature. This promise however is yet to be fulfilled, with search for relevant literature for a given patient condition still being an active research topic. The TREC CDS track was designed to address this research gap. We developed a platform to facilitate experimentation and hypothesis testing for information retrieval researchers working on this topic. It provides a large range of query and document processing techniques that are explored in the biomedical search domain.

   Embeddings; Image Embeddings
AB Online media outlets, in a bid to expand their reach and subsequently increase revenue through ad monetisation, have begun adopting clickbait techniques to lure readers to click on articles. The article fails to fulfill the promise made by the headline. Traditional methods for clickbait detection have relied heavily on feature engineering which, in turn, is dependent on the dataset it is built for. The application of neural networks for this task has only been explored partially. We propose a novel approach considering all information found in a social media post. We train a bidirectional LSTM with an attention mechanism to learn the extent to which a word contributes to the post's clickbait score in a differential manner. We also employ a Siamese net to capture the similarity between source and target information. Information gleaned from images has not been considered in previous approaches. We learn image embeddings from large amounts of data using Convolutional Neural Networks to add another layer of complexity to our model. Finally, we concatenate the outputs from the three separate components, serving it as input to a fully connected layer. We conduct experiments over a test corpus of 19538 social media posts, attaining an F1 score of 65.37% on the dataset bettering the previous state-of-the-art, as well as other proposed approaches, feature engineering or otherwise.

DE Crowdsourcing; Relevance Assessment; Evaluation; Disagreement
AB While crowdsourcing offers a low-cost, scalable way to collect relevance judgments, lack of transparency with remote crowd work has limited understanding about the quality of collected judgments. In prior work, we showed a variety of benefits from asking crowd workers to provide rationales for each relevance judgment [21]. In this work, we scale up our rationale-based judging design to assess its reliability on the 2014 TREC Web Track, collecting roughly 25K crowd judgments for 5K document-topic pairs. We also study having crowd judges perform topic-focused judging, rather than across topics, finding this improves quality. Overall, we show that crowd judgments can be used to reliably rank IR systems for evaluation.
   We further explore the potential of rationales to shed new light on reasons for judging disagreement between experts and crowd workers. Our qualitative and quantitative analysis distinguishes subjective vs. objective forms of disagreement, as well as the relative importance of each disagreement cause, and we present a new taxonomy for organizing the different types of disagreement we observe. We show that many crowd disagreements seem valid and plausible, with disagreement in many cases due to judging errors by the original TREC assessors. We also share our WEBCRowD25K dataset, including: (1) crowd judgments with rationales, and (2) taxonomy category labels for each judging disagreement analyzed.

DE Sentiment knowledge; mutual attention; multi-source attention
AB Analyzing public opinions towards products, services and social events is an important but challenging task. Despite the remarkable successes of deep neural networks in sentiment analysis, these approaches do not make full use of the prior sentiment knowledge (e.g., sentiment lexicon, negation words, intensity words). In this paper, we propose a Sentiment-Aware Attention Network (SAAN) to boost the performance of sentiment analysis, which adopts a three-step strategy to learn the sentiment-specific sentence representation. First, we employ a word-level mutual attention mechanism to model word-level correlation. Next, a phrase-level convolutional attention is designed to obtain phrase-level correlation. Finally, a sentence-level multi-head attention mechanism is proposed to capture various sentimental information from different subspaces. The experiments on Movie Review (MR) and Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) show that our model consistently outperform the previous methods for sentiment analysis.

DE Location-based Search; Route Planning; Diversity Requirement
AB We consider a practical top-k route search problem: given a collection of points of interest (POIs) with rated features and traveling costs between POIs, a user wants to find k routes from a source to a destination and limited in a cost budget, that maximally match her needs on feature preferences. One challenge is dealing with the personalized diversity requirement where users have various trade-off between quantity (the number of POIs with a specified feature) and variety (the coverage of specified features). Another challenge is the large scale of the POI map and the great many alternative routes to search. We model the personalized diversity requirement by the whole class of submodular functions, and present an optimal solution to the top-k route search problem through indices for retrieving relevant POIs in both feature and route spaces and various strategies for pruning the search space using user preferences and constraints. We also present promising heuristic solutions and evaluate all the solutions on real life data.

DE Temporal Memory Attention; Cross-modal Retrieval; Moment Localization;
   Tensor Fusion
AB In the past few years, language-based video retrieval has attracted a lot of attention. However, as a natural extension, localizing the specific video moments within a video given a description query is seldom explored. Although these two tasks look similar, the latter is more challenging due to two main reasons: 1) The former task only needs to judge whether the query occurs in a video and returns an entire video, but the latter is expected to judge which moment within a video matches the query and accurately returns the start and end points of the moment. Due to the fact that different moments in a video have varying durations and diverse spatial-temporal characteristics, uncovering the underlying moments is highly challenging. 2) As for the key component of relevance estimation, the former usually embeds a video and the query into a common space to compute the relevance score. However, the later task concerns moment localization where not only the features of a specific moment matter, but the context information of the moment also contributes a lot. For example, the query may contain temporal constraint words, such as "first", therefore temporal context is required to properly comprehend them.
   To address these issues, we develop an Attentive Cross-Modal Retrieval Network. In particular, we design a memory attention mechanism to emphasize the visual features mentioned in the query and simultaneously incorporate their context. In the light of this, we obtain an augmented moment representation. Meanwhile, a cross-modal fusion sub-network learns both the intra-modality and inter-modality dynamics, which can enhance the learning of moment-query representation. We evaluate our method on two datasets: DiDeMo and TACoS. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our model as compared to state-of-the-art methods.

DE BitFunnel; Bloom filter; compression; query processing
AB Large-scale search engines utilize inverted indexes which store ordered lists of document identifies (docIDs) relevant to query terms, which can be queried thousands of times per second. In order to reduce storage requirements, we propose a dictionary-based compression approach for the recently proposed bitwise data-structure BitFunnel, which makes use of a Bloom filter. Compression is achieved through storing frequently occurring blocks in a dictionary. Infrequently occurring blocks (those which are not represented in the dictionary) are instead referenced using similar blocks that are in the dictionary, introducing additional false positive errors. We further introduce a docID reordering strategy to improve compression.
   Experimental results indicate an improvement in compression by 27% to 30%, at the expense of increasing the query processing time by 16% to 48% and increasing the false positive rate by around 7.6 to 10.7 percentage points.

DE Learning to Rank; Multiple Additive Regression Trees; Boosting
AB Learning an effective ranking function from a large number of query-document examples is a challenging task. Indeed, training sets where queries are associated with a few relevant documents and a large number of irrelevant ones are required to model real scenarios of Web search production systems, where a query can possibly retrieve thousands of matching documents, but only a few of them are actually relevant. In this paper, we propose SELECTIVE GRADIENT BOOSTING (SELGB), an algorithm addressing the Learning-to-Rank task by focusing on those irrelevant documents that are most likely to be mis-ranked, thus severely hindering the quality of the learned model. SELGB exploits a novel technique minimizing the mis-ranking risk, i.e., the probability that two randomly drawn instances are ranked incorrectly, within a gradient boosting process that iteratively generates an additive ensemble of decision trees. Specifically, at every iteration and on a per query basis, SELGB selectively chooses among the training instances a small sample of negative examples enhancing the discriminative power of the learned model. Reproducible and comprehensive experiments conducted on a publicly available dataset show that SELGB exploits the diversity and variety of the negative examples selected to train tree ensembles that outperform models generated by state-of-the-art algorithms by achieving improvements of NDCG@10 up to 3.2%.

   Supervised Hashing
AB Despite significant progress in supervised hashing, there are three common limitations of existing methods. First, most pioneer methods discretely learn hash codes bit by bit, making the learning procedure rather time-consuming. Second, to reduce the large complexity of the n by n pairwise similarity matrix, most methods apply sampling strategies during training, which inevitably results in information loss and suboptimal performance; some recent methods try to replace the large matrix with a smaller one, but the size is still large. Third, among the methods that leverage the pairwise similarity matrix, most of them only encode the semantic label information in learning the hash codes, failing to fully capture the characteristics of data. In this paper, we present a novel supervised hashing method, called Fast Scalable Supervised Hashing (FSSH), which circumvents the use of the large similarity matrix by introducing a pre-computed intermediate term whose size is independent with the size of training data. Moreover, FSSH can learn the hash codes with not only the semantic information but also the features of data. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate its superiority over several state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and scalability.

DE Mention Recommendation; Multimodal Attention; Social Medias
AB The users of Twitter-like social media normally use the "@" sign to select a suitable person to mention. It is a significant role in promoting the user experience and information propagation. To help users easily find the usernames they want to mention, the mention recommendation task has received considerable attention in recent years. Previous methods only incorporated textual information when performing this task. However, many users not only post texts on social media but also the corresponding images. These images can provide additional information that is not included in the text, which could be helpful in improving the accuracy of a mention recommendation. To make full use of textual and visual information, we propose a novel cross-attention memory network to perform the mention recommendation task for multimodal tweets. We incorporate the interests of users with external memory and use the cross-attention mechanism to extract both textual and visual information. Experimental results on a dataset collected from Twitter demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods that use textual information only.

AB Complex answer retrieval (CAR) is the process of retrieving answers to questions that have multifaceted or nuanced answers. In this work, we present two novel approaches for CAR based on the observation that question facets can vary in utility: from structural (facets that can apply to many similar topics, such as 'History') to topical (facets that are specific to the question's topic, such as the `Westward expansion' of the United States). We first explore a way to incorporate facet utility into ranking models during query term score combination. We then explore a general approach to reform the structure of ranking models to aid in learning of facet utility in the query-document term matching phase. When we use our techniques with a leading neural ranker on the TREC CAR dataset, our methods yield statistically significant improvements over both an unmodified neural architecture and submitted TREC runs.

AB Venue recommendation systems aim to effectively rank a list of interesting venues users should visit based on their historical feedback (e.g. checkins). Such systems are increasingly deployed by Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) such as Foursquare and Yelp to enhance their usefulness to users. Recently, various RNN architectures have been proposed to incorporate contextual information associated with the users' sequence of checkins (e.g. time of the day, location of venues) to effectively capture the users' dynamic preferences. However, these architectures assume that different types of contexts have an identical impact on the users' preferences, which may not hold in practice. For example, an ordinary context - such as the time of the day - reflects the user's current contextual preferences, whereas a transition context - such as a time interval from their last visited venue - indicates a transition effect from past behaviour to future behaviour. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Contextual Attention Recurrent Architecture (CARA) that leverages both sequences of feedback and contextual information associated with the sequences to capture the users' dynamic preferences. Our proposed recurrent architecture consists of two types of gating mechanisms, namely 1) a contextual attention gate that controls the influence of the ordinary context on the users' contextual preferences and 2) a time- and geo-based gate that controls the influence of the hidden state from the previous checkin based on the transition context. Thorough experiments on three large checkin and rating datasets from commercial LBSNs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CARA architecture by significantly outperforming many state-of-the-art RNN architectures and factorisation approaches.

AB Over the last few years, an increasing number of user's and enterprises on the internet has generated a global marketplace for both employers and job seekers. Despite the fact that online job search is now more preferable than traditional methods - leading to better matches between the job seekers and the employer's intents - there is still little insight into how online job searches are different from general web searches. In this paper, we explore the different characteristics of online job search and their differences with general searches, by leveraging search engine query logs. Our experimental results show that job searches have specific attributes which can be used by search engines to increase the quality of the search results.

AB Some methods have been developed for automatic effectiveness evaluation without relevance judgments. We propose to use those methods, and their combination based on a machine learning approach, for query performance prediction. Moreover, since predicting average precision as it is usually done in query performance prediction literature is sensitive to the reference system that is chosen, we focus on predicting the average of average precision values over several systems. Results of an extensive experimental evaluation on ten TREC collections show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art query performance predictors.

AB We consider two recent proposals for effectiveness metrics that have been argued to be adaptive, those of Moffat et al. (ACM TOIS, 2017) andhang and Allan (CIKM, 2017), and consider the user interaction models that they give rise to. By categorizing non-relevant documents into those that are plausibly non-relevant and those that are egregiously non-relevant, we capture all of the attributes incorporated into the two proposals, and hence develop an effectiveness metric that better reflects user behavior when viewing the SERP, including bad abandonment.

AB Selective search architectures use resource selection algorithms such as Rank-S or Taily to rank index shards and determine how many to search for a given query. Most prior research evaluated solutions by their ability to improve efficiency without significantly reducing early-precision metrics such as P@5 and NDCG@10.
   This paper recasts selective search as an early stage of a multi-stage retrieval architecture, which makes recall-oriented metrics more appropriate. A new algorithm is presented that predicts the number of shards that must be searched for a given query in order to meet recall-oriented goals. Decoupling shard ranking from deciding how many shards to search clarifies efficiency vs. effectiveness trade-offs, and enables them to be optimized independently. Experiments on two corpora demonstrate the value of this approach.

DE Answer selection; non-factoid QA; representation learning; attention
   mechanism
AB Attention based neural network models have been successfully applied in answer selection, which is an important subtask of question answering (QA). These models often represent a question by a single vector and find its corresponding matches by attending to candidate answers. However, questions and answers might be related to each other in complicated ways which cannot be captured by single-vector representations. In this paper, we propose Multihop Attention Networks (MAN) which aim to uncover these complex relations for ranking question and answer pairs. Unlike previous models, we do not collapse the question into a single vector, instead we use multiple vectors which focus on different parts of the question for its overall semantic representation and apply multiple steps of attention to learn representations for the candidate answers. For each attention step, in addition to common attention mechanisms, we adopt sequential attention which utilizes context information for computing context-aware attention weights. Via extensive experiments, we show that MAN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on popular benchmark QA datasets. Empirical studies confirm the effectiveness of sequential attention over other attention mechanisms.

AB Recent neural models for IR have produced good retrieval effectiveness compared with traditional models. Yet all of them assume that a single matching function should be used for all queries. In practice, user's queries may be of various nature which might require different levels of matching, from low level word matching to high level conceptual matching. To cope with this problem, we propose a multi-level abstraction convolutional model (MACM) that generates and aggregates several levels of matching scores. Weak supervision is used to address the problem of large training data. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed MACM model.

DE Complex ranking; learning to rank; deep reinforcement learning
AB Learning to Rank has traditionally considered settings where given the relevance information of objects, the desired order in which to rank the objects is clear. However, with today's large variety of users and layouts this is not always the case. In this paper, we consider so-called complex ranking settings where it is not clear what should be displayed, that is, what the relevant items are, and how they should be displayed, that is, where the most relevant items should be placed. These ranking settings are complex as they involve both traditional ranking and inferring the best display order. Existing learning to rank methods cannot handle such complex ranking settings as they assume that the display order is known beforehand. To address this gap we introduce a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning method that is capable of learning complex rankings, both the layout and the best ranking given the layout, from weak reward signals. Our proposed method does so by selecting documents and positions sequentially, hence it ranks both the documents and positions, which is why we call it the Double-Rank Model (DRM). Our experiments show that DRM outperforms all existing methods in complex ranking settings, thus it leads to substantial ranking improvements in cases where the display order is not known a priori.

DE Location prediction; Kernel density estimation; tweet localization
AB We propose a location prediction method for tweets based on the geographical probability distribution of their terms over a region. In our method, the probabilities are calculated using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), where the bandwidth of the kernel function for each term is determined separately according to the location indicativeness of the term. Prediction for a new tweet is performed by combining the probability distributions of its terms weighted by their information gain ratio. The method we propose relies on statistical approaches without requiring any parameter tuning. Experiments conducted on three tweet sets from different regions of the world indicate significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Collaborative search has been an active area of research within the IR community for many years. While for "single-user" research a variety of up-to-date open-source search systems exist, few "multiuser" search tools are open-source and even fewer are being maintained. In this paper, we present SearchX, an open-source collaborative search system we are currently developing-and using for our research. We designed and built SearchX using the modern Web stack (and are thus not siloed by an operating system or a particular browser type), enabling efficient research across platforms (Desktop, mobile) and with online users (e.g. crowdworkers). A video, describing the demo can be found at https: //www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf24m6p3vts.

DE IR Evaluation; Relevance Scales
AB In Information Retrieval evaluation, the classical approach of adopting binary relevance judgments has been replaced by multi-level relevance judgments and by gain-based metrics leveraging such multi-level judgment scales. Recent work has also proposed and evaluated unbounded relevance scales by means of Magnitude Estimation (ME) and compared them with multi-level scales. While ME brings advantages like the ability for assessors to always judge the next document as having higher or lower relevance than any of the documents they have judged so far, it also comes with some drawbacks. For example, it is not a natural approach for human assessors to judge items as they are used to do on the Web (e.g., 5-star rating).
   In this work, we propose and experimentally evaluate a bounded and fine-grained relevance scale having many of the advantages and dealing with some of the issues of ME. We collect relevance judgments over a 100-level relevance scale (S100) by means of a large-scale crowdsourcing experiment and compare the results with other relevance scales (binary, 4-level, and ME) showing the benefit of fine-grained scales over both coarse-grained and unbounded scales as well as highlighting some new results on ME.
   Our results show that S100 maintains the flexibility of unbounded scales like ME in providing assessors with ample choice when judging document relevance (i.e., assessors can fit relevance judgments in between of previously given judgments). It also allows assessors to judge on a more familiar scale (e.g., on 10 levels) and to perform efficiently since the very first judging task.

DE Social Media; Instagram; Influence; Ranking
AB This paper focuses on the problem of scoring and ranking influential users of Instagram, a visual content sharing online social network (OSN). Instagram is the second largest OSN in the world with 700 million active Instagram accounts, 32% of all worldwide Internet users l . Among the millions of users, photos shared by more influential users are viewed by more users than posts shared by less influential counterparts. This raises the question of how to identify those influential Instagram users.
   In our work, we present and discuss the lack of relevant tools and insufficient metrics for influence measurement, focusing on a network oblivious approach and show that the graph-based approach used in other OSNs is a poor fit for Instagram. In our study, we consider user statistics, some of which are more intuitive than others, and several regression models to measure users influence.

AB We present an Information Retrieval framework that leverages Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) embeddings for contextual suggestion. Our method represents users, documents and other context-related documents as heterogeneous objects in a HIN. Using meta-paths, selected based on domain knowledge, we create graph embeddings from this network, thereby learning a representation of users and objects in the same semantic vector space. This allows inferences of user interest on unseen objects based on distance in the embedding space. These object distances are then incorporated as features in a well-established learning to rank (LTR) framework. We make use of the 2016 TREC Contextual Suggestion (TRECCS) dataset, which contains user profiles in the form of relevance-rated documents, and demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach by comparing our system to the best performing systems of the TRECCS task.

DE Interactive Information Retrieval; Concept and Entity Embeddings
AB We present a novel interactive framework for patent retrieval leveraging distributed representations of concepts and entities extracted from the patents text. We propose a simple and practical interactive relevance feedback mechanism where the user is asked to annotate relevant/irrelevant results from the top n hits. We then utilize this feedback for query reformulation and term weighting where weights are assigned based on how good each term is at discriminating the relevant vs. irrelevant candidates. First, we demonstrate the efficacy of the distributed representations on the CLEF-IP 2010 dataset where we achieve significant improvement of 4.6% in recall over the keyword search baseline. Second, we simulate interactivity to demonstrate the efficacy of our interactive term weighting mechanism. Simulation results show that we can achieve significant improvement in recall from one interaction iteration outperforming previous semantic and interactive patent retrieval methods.

DE ontology evaluation; information entropy; semantics
AB With the rising importance of knowledge exchange, ontologies have become a key technology in the development of shared knowledge models for semantic-driven applications, such as knowledge interchange and semantic integration. Significant progress has been made in the use of entropy to measure the predictability and redundancy of knowledge bases, particularly ontologies. However, the current entropy applications used to evaluate ontologies consider only single-point connectivity rather than path connectivity, assign equal weights to each entity and path, and assume that vertices are static. To address these deficiencies, the present study proposes a Path-based Text-aware Entropy Computation method, PTEC, by considering the path information between different vertices and the textual information within the path to calculate the connectivity path of the whole network and the different weights between various nodes. Information obtained from structure-based embedding and text-based embedding is multiplied by the connectivity matrix of the entropy computation. An experimental evaluation of three real-world ontologies is performed based on ontology statistical information (data quantity), entropy evaluation (data quality), and a case study (ontology structure and text visualization). These aspects mutually demonstrate the reliability of our method. Experimental results demonstrate that PTEC can effectively evaluate ontologies, particularly those in the medical field.

ID SHRINKAGE
AB The booming of social networks has given rise to a large volume of user-generated contents (UGCs), most of which are free and publicly available. A lot of users' personal aspects can be extracted from these UGCs to facilitate personalized applications as validated by many previous studies. Despite their value, UGCs can place users at high privacy risks, which thus far remains largely untapped. Privacy is defined as the individual's ability to control what information is disclosed, to whom, when and under what circumstances. As people and information both play significant roles, privacy has been elaborated as a boundary regulation process, where individuals regulate interaction with others by altering the openness degree of themselves to others. In this paper, we aim to reduce users' privacy risks on social networks by answering the question of Who Can See What. Towards this goal, we present a novel scheme, comprising of descriptive, predictive and prescriptive components. In particular, we first collect a set of posts and extract a group of privacy-oriented features to describe the posts. We then propose a novel taxonomy-guided multi-task learning model to predict which personal aspects are uncovered by the posts. Lastly, we construct standard guidelines by the user study with 400 users to regularize users' actions for preventing their privacy leakage. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset well verified our scheme.

AB Beyond word embeddings, continuous representations of knowledge graph (KG) components, such as entities, types and relations, are widely used for entity mention disambiguation, relation inference and deep question answering. Great strides have been made in modeling general, asymmetric or antisymmetric KG relations using Gaussian, holographic, and complex embeddings. None of these directly enforce transitivity inherent in the is-instance-of and is-subtype-of relations. A recent proposal, called order embedding (OE), demands that the vector representing a subtype elementwise dominates the vector representing a supertype. However, the manner in which such constraints are asserted and evaluated have some limitations. In this short research note, we make three contributions specific to representing and inferring transitive relations. First, we propose and justify a significant improvement to the OE loss objective. Second, we propose a new representation of types as hyper-rectangular regions, that generalize and improve on OE. Third, we show that some current protocols to evaluate transitive relation inference can be misleading, and offer a sound alternative. Rather than use black-box deep learning modules off-the-shelf, we develop our training networks using elementary geometric considerations.

ID STRATEGIES
AB Typically, techniques that benefit effectiveness of information retrieval (IR) systems have a negative impact on efficiency. Yet, with the large scale of Web search engines, there is a need to deploy efficient query processing techniques to reduce the cost of the infrastructure required. This tutorial aims to provide a detailed overview of the infrastructure of an IR system devoted to the efficient yet effective processing of user queries. This tutorial guides the attendees through the main ideas, approaches and algorithms developed in the last 30 years in query processing. In particular, we illustrate, with detailed examples and simplified pseudo-code, the most important query processing strategies adopted in major search engines, with a particular focus on dynamic pruning techniques. Moreover, we present and discuss the state-of-the-art innovations in query processing, such as impact-sorted and blockmax indexes. We also describe how modern search engines exploit such algorithms with learning-to-rank (LtR) models to produce effective results, exploiting new approaches in LtR query processing. Finally, this tutorial introduces query efficiency predictors for dynamic pruning, and discusses their main applications to scheduling, routing, selective processing and parallelisation of query processing, as deployed by a major search engine.

DE Online learning to rank; Dueling bandit; Null space exploration
AB Online learning to rank (OL2R) optimizes the utility of returned search results based on implicit feedback gathered directly from users. To improve the estimates, OL2R algorithms examine one or more exploratory gradient directions and update the current ranker if a proposed one is preferred by users via an interleaved test.
   In this paper, we accelerate the online learning process by efficient exploration in the gradient space. Our algorithm, named as Null Space Gradient Descent, reduces the exploration space to only the null space of recent poorly performing gradients. This prevents the algorithm from repeatedly exploring directions that have been discouraged by the most recent interactions with users. To improve sensitivity of the resulting interleaved test, we selectively construct candidate rankers to maximize the chance that they can be differentiated by candidate ranking documents in the current query; and we use historically difficult queries to identify the best ranker when tie occurs in comparing the rankers. Extensive experimental comparisons with the state-of-the-art OL2R algorithms on several public benchmarks confirmed the effectiveness of our proposal algorithm, especially in its fast learning convergence and promising ranking quality at an early stage.

AB Explaining automatically generated recommendations allows users to make more informed and accurate decisions about which results to utilize, and therefore improves their satisfaction. In this work, we develop a multi-task learning solution for explainable recommendation. Two companion learning tasks of user preference modeling for recommendation and opinionated content modeling for explanation are integrated via a joint tensor factorization. As a result, the algorithm predicts not only a user's preference over a list of items, i.e., recommendation, but also how the user would appreciate a particular item at the feature level, i.e., opinionated textual explanation. Extensive experiments on two large collections of Amazon and Yelp reviews confirmed the effectiveness of our solution in both recommendation and explanation tasks, compared with several existing recommendation algorithms. And our extensive user study clearly demonstrates the practical value of the explainable recommendations generated by our algorithm.

AB This paper presents a new trajectory search engine called Torch for querying road network trajectory data. Torch is able to efficiently process two types of typical queries (similarity search and Boolean search), and support a wide variety of trajectory similarity functions. Additionally, we propose a new similarity function LORS in Torch to measure the similarity in a more effective and efficient manner. Indexing and search in Torch works as follows. First, each raw vehicle trajectory is transformed to a set of road segments (edges) and a set of crossings (vertices) on the road network. Then a lightweight edge and vertex index called LEVI is built. Given a query, a filtering framework over LEVI is used to dynamically prune the trajectory search space based on the similarity measure imposed. Finally, the result set (ranked or Boolean) is returned. Extensive experiments on real trajectory datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of Torch.

AB Stance detection aims at inferring from text whether the author is in favor of, against, or neutral towards a target entity. Most of the existing studies consider different target entities separately. However, in many scenarios, stance targets are closely related, such as several candidates in a general election and different brands of the same product. Multi-target stance detection, in contrast, aims at jointly detecting stances towards multiple related targets. As stance expression regarding a target can provide additional information to help identify the stances towards other related targets, modeling expressions regarding multiple targets jointly is beneficial for improving the overall performance compared to single-target scheme. In this paper, we propose a dynamic memory-augmented network DMAN for multi-target stance detection. DMAN utilizes a shared external memory, which is dynamically updated through the learning process, to capture and store stance-indicative information for multiple related targets. It then jointly predicts stances towards these targets in a multitask manner. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset show the effectiveness of DMAN.

AB In recent years, product search engines have emerged as a key factor for online businesses. According to a recent survey, over 55% of online customers begin their online shopping journey by searching on an E-Commerce (EC) website like Amazon as opposed to a generic web search engine like Google(1). Information retrieval research to date has been focused on optimizing search ranking algorithms for web documents while little attention has been paid to product search. There are several intrinsic differences between web search and product search that make the direct application of traditional search ranking algorithms to EC search platforms difficult. First, the success of web and product search is measured differently; one seeks to optimize for relevance while the other must optimize for both relevance and revenue. Second, when using real-world EC transaction data, there is no access to manually annotated labels. In this paper, we address these differences with a novel learning framework for EC product search called LETORIF (LEarning TO Rank with Implicit Feedback). In this framework, we utilize implicit user feedback signals (such as user clicks and purchases) and jointly model the different stages of the shopping journey to optimize for EC sales revenue. We conduct experiments on real-world EC transaction data and introduce a a new evaluation metric to estimate expected revenue after re-ranking. Experimental results show that LETORIF outperforms top competitors in improving purchase rates and total revenue earned.

AB Matching is the key problem in both search and recommendation, that is to measure the relevance of a document to a query or the interest of a user on an item. Previously, machine learning methods have been exploited to address the problem, which learns a matching function from labeled data, also referred to as "learning to match" [21]. In recent years, deep learning has been successfully applied to matching and significant progresses have been made. Deep semantic matching models for search [25] and neural collaborative filtering models for recommendation [12] are becoming the state-of-the-art technologies. The key to the success of the deep learning approach is its strong ability in learning of representations and generalization of matching patterns from raw data (e.g., queries, documents, users, and items, particularly in their raw forms). In this tutorial, we aim to give a comprehensive survey on recent progress in deep learning for matching in search and recommendation. Our tutorial is unique in that we try to give a unified view on search and recommendation. In this way, we expect researchers from the two fields can get deep understanding and accurate insight on the spaces, stimulate more ideas and discussions, and promote developments of technologies.
   The tutorial mainly consists of three parts. Firstly, we introduce the general problem of matching, which is fundamental in both search and recommendation. Secondly, we explain how traditional machine learning techniques are utilized to address the matching problem in search and recommendation. Lastly, we elaborate how deep learning can be effectively used to solve the matching problems in both tasks.

AB Web search is frequently used by people to acquire new knowledge and to satisfy learning-related objectives. In this context, informational search missions with an intention to obtain knowledge pertaining to a topic are prominent. The importance of learning as an outcome of web search has been recognized. Yet, there is a lack of understanding of the impact of web search on a user's knowledge state. Predicting the knowledge gain of users can be an important step forward if web search engines that are currently optimized for relevance can be molded to serve learning outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a supervised model to predict a user's knowledge state and knowledge gain from features captured during the search sessions. To measure and predict the knowledge gain of users in informational search sessions, we recruited 468 distinct users using crowdsourcing and orchestrated real-world search sessions spanning 11 different topics and information needs. By using scientifically formulated knowledge tests, we calibrated the knowledge of users before and after their search sessions, quantifying their knowledge gain. Our supervised models utilise and derive a comprehensive set of features from the current state of the art and compare performance of a range of feature sets and feature selection strategies. Through our results, we demonstrate the ability to predict and classify the knowledge state and gain using features obtained during search sessions, exhibiting superior performance to an existing baseline in the knowledge state prediction task.

AB In recent years, machine learning approaches, and in particular deep neural networks, have yielded significant improvements on several natural language processing and computer vision tasks; however, such breakthroughs have not yet been observed in the area of information retrieval. Besides the complexity of IR tasks, such as understanding the user's information needs, a main reason is the lack of high-quality and/or large-scale training data for many IR tasks. This necessitates studying how to design and train machine learning algorithms where there is no large-scale or high-quality data in hand. Therefore, considering the quick progress in development of machine learning models, this is an ideal time for a workshop that especially focuses on learning in such an important and challenging setting for IR tasks.
   The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from industry-where data is plentiful but noisy-with researchers from academia-where data is sparse but clean to discuss solutions to these related problems.

   Clustering
AB Document clustering is central in modern information retrieval applications. Among existing models, non-negative-matrix factorization (NMF) approaches have proven effective for this task. However, NMF approaches, like other models in this context, exhibit a major drawback, namely they use the bag-of-word representation and, thus, do not account for the sequential order in which words occur in documents. This is an important issue since it may result in a significant loss of semantics. In this paper, we aim to address the above issue and propose a new model which successfully integrates a word embedding model, word2vec, into an NMF framework so as to leverage the semantic relationships between words. Empirical results, on several real-world datasets, demonstrate the benefits of our model in terms of text document clustering as well as document/word embedding.

DE Verbose queries; query length; axiomatic analysis; theoretical analysis;
   term discrimination
AB Number of terms in a query is a query-specific constant that is typically ignored in retrieval functions. However, previous studies have shown that the performance of retrieval models varies for different query lengths, and it usually degrades when query length increases. A possible reason for this issue can be the extraneous terms in longer queries that makes it a challenge for the retrieval models to distinguish between the key and complementary concepts of the query. As a signal to understand the importance of a term, inverse document frequency (IDF) can be used to discriminate query terms. In this paper, we propose a constraint to model the interaction between query length and IDF. Our theoretical analysis shows that current state-of-the-art retrieval models, such as BM25, do not satisfy the proposed constraint. We further analyze the BM25 model and suggest a modification to adapt BM25 so that it adheres to the new constraint. Our experiments on three TREC collections demonstrate that the proposed modification outperforms the baselines, especially for verbose queries.

AB Traditional sentiment analysis approaches tackle problems like ternary (3-category) and fine-grained (5-category) classification by learning the tasks separately. We argue that such classification tasks are correlated and we propose a multitask approach based on a recurrent neural network that benefits by jointly learning them. Our study demonstrates the potential of multitask models on this type of problems and improves the state-of-the-art results in the fine-grained sentiment classification problem.

   question answering
AB In many Information Retrieval tasks the boundary between classes is not well defined and assigning a document to a specific class may be complicated, even for humans. For instance, a document which is not directly related to the user's query may still contain relevant information. In this scenario, an option is to define an intermediate class collecting ambiguous instances. Yet some natural questions arise. Is this annotation strategy convenient? How should the intermediate class be treated?
   To answer these questions, we explored two community question answering datasets whose comments were originally annotated with three classes and re-annotated a subset of instances considering a binary good vs bad setting. Our main contribution is to show empirically that the inclusion of an intermediate class to assess Boolean relevance is not useful. Moreover, in case the data is already annotated with a 3-class strategy, the instances from the intermediate class can be safely removed at training time.

AB Online service providers gather vast amounts of data to build user profiles. Such profiles improve service quality through personalization, but may also intrude on user privacy and incur discrimination risks. In this work, we propose a framework which leverages solidarity in a large community to scramble user interaction histories. While this is beneficial for anti- profiling, the potential downside is that individual user utility, in terms of the quality of search results or recommendations, may severely degrade. To reconcile privacy and user utility and control their trade- off we develop quantitative models for these dimensions and e, ective strategies for assigning user interactions to Mediator Accounts. We demonstrate the viability of our framework by experiments in two di, erent application areas (search and recommender systems), using two large datasets.

DE information retrieval; evaluation; statistical significance testing;
   reproducibility
AB The past 20 years have seen a great improvement in the rigor of information retrieval experimentation, due primarily to two factors: high-quality, public, portable test collections such as those produced by TREC (the Text REtrieval Conference [38]), and the increased practice of statistical hypothesis testing to determine whether measured improvements can be ascribed to something other than random chance. Together these create a very useful standard for reviewers, program committees, and journal editors; work in information retrieval (IR) increasingly cannot be published unless it has been evaluated using a well-constructed test collection and shown to produce a statistically significant improvement over a good baseline.
   But, as the saying goes, any tool sharp enough to be useful is also sharp enough to be dangerous. Statistical tests of significance are widely misunderstood. Most researchers and developers treat them as a "black box": evaluation results go in and a p-value comes out. But because significance is such an important factor in determining what research directions to explore and what is published, using p-values obtained without thought can have consequences for everyone doing research in IR. Ioannidis has argued that the main consequence in the biomedical sciences is that most published research findings are false [20]; could that be the case in IR as well?

AB Incorporating conventional, unsupervised features into a neural architecture has the potential to improve modeling effectiveness, but this aspect is often overlooked in the research of deep learning models for information retrieval. We investigate this incorporation in the context of answer sentence selection, and show that combining a set of query matching, readability, and query focus features into a simple convolutional neural network can lead to markedly increased effectiveness. Our results on two standard question-answering datasets show the effectiveness of the combined model.

AB In this paper, we leverage high-dimensional side information to enhance top-N recommendations. To reduce the impact of the curse of high dimensionality, we incorporate a dimensionality reduction method, Locality Preserving Projection (LPP), into the recommendation model. A joint learning model is proposed to achieve the task of dimensionality reduction and recommendation simultaneously and iteratively. Specifically, item similarities generated by the recommendation model are used as the weights of the adjacency graph for LPP while the projections are used to bias the learning of item similarity. Employing LPP for recommendation not only preserves locality but also improves item similarity. Our experimental results illustrate that the proposed method is superior over state-of-the-art methods.

   Network; Long-Short Term Memory Model
AB A novel hierarchical multimodal attention-based model is developed in this paper to generate more accurate and descriptive captions for images. Our model is an "end-to-end" neural network which contains three related sub-networks: a deep convolutional neural network to encode image contents, a recurrent neural network to identify the objects in images sequentially, and a multimodal attention-based recurrent neural network to generate image captions. The main contribution of our work is that the hierarchical structure and multimodal attention mechanism is both applied, thus each caption word can be generated with the multimodal attention on the intermediate semantic objects and the global visual content. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets have obtained very positive results.

AB About eight decades ago, Zipf postulated that the word frequency distribution of languages is a power law, i.e., it is a straight line on a log-log plot. Over the years, this phenomenon has been documented and studied extensively. For many corpora, however, the empirical distribution barely resembles a power law: when plotted on a log-log scale, the distribution is concave and appears to be composed of two differently sloped straight lines joined by a smooth curve. A simple generative model is proposed to capture this phenomenon. The word frequency distributions produced by this model are shown to match the observations both analytically and empirically.

AB Tweets summarization aims to find a group of representative tweets for a specific topic. In recent times, there have been several research efforts toward devising a variety of techniques to summarize tweets in Twitter. However, these techniques are either not personal (i.e., consider only tweets in the timeline of a specific user) or are too expensive to be realized on a mobile device. Given that 80% of active Twitter users access the site on mobile devices, in this demonstration we present a lightweight, personalized, on-demand, topic modeling-based tweets summarization engine called TOTEM, designed for such devices. Specifically, TOTEM summarizes most recent tweets on a user's timeline and enables her to visualize and navigate representative topics and associated tweets in a user-friendly tap-and-swipe manner.

AB Over the past years, several challenges and calls for research projects have pointed out the dire need for pushing natural language interfaces. In this context, the importance of Semantic Web data as a premier knowledge source is rapidly increasing. But we are still far from having accurate natural language interfaces that allow handling complex information needs in a user-centric and highly performant manner. The development of such interfaces requires collaboration of a range of different fields, including natural language processing, information extraction, knowledge base construction and population, reasoning, and question answering. With the goal to join forces in the collaborative development of natural language QA systems, the second OKBQA workshop is organized within the 40th SIGIR conference.

DE Text Summarization; Scientific Text; Information Retrieval
AB Citation texts are sometimes not very informative or in some cases inaccurate by themselves; they need the appropriate context from the referenced paper to reflect its exact contributions. To address this problem, we propose an unsupervised model that uses distributed representation of words as well as domain knowledge to extract the appropriate context from the reference paper. Evaluation results show the effectiveness of our model by significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art. We furthermore demonstrate how an effective contextualization method results in improving citation-based summarization of the scientific articles.

DE eCommerce; Product Search; Recommendation
AB eCommerce Information Retrieval has received little attention in the academic literature, yet it is an essential component of some of the largest web sites (such as eBay, Amazon, Airbnb, Alibaba, Taobao, Target, Facebook, and others). SIGIR has for several years seen sponsorship from these kinds of organisations, who clearly value the importance of research into Information Retrieval. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners of eCommerce IR to discuss topics unique to it, to set a research agenda, and to examine how to build a dataset for research into this fascinating topic. eCommerce IR is ripe for research and has a unique set of problems. For example, in eCommerce search there may be no hypertext links between documents (products); there is a click stream, but more importantly, there is often a buy stream. eCommerce problems are wide in scope and range from user interaction modalities (the kinds of search seen in when buying are different from those of web-page search (i.e. it is not clear how shopping and buying relate to the standard web-search interaction models)) through to dynamic updates of a rapidly changing collection on auction sites, and the experienceness of some products (such as Airbnb bookings).

AB Knowledge graphs have been used throughout the history of information retrieval for a variety of tasks. Technological advances in knowledge acquisition and alignment technology from the last few years gave rise to a body of new approaches for utilizing knowledge graphs in text retrieval tasks. It is therefore time to consolidate the community efforts in studying how knowledge graph technology can be employed in information retrieval systems in the most effective way. It is also time to start a dialogue with researchers working on knowledge acquisition and alignment to ensure that resulting technologies and algorithms meet the demands posed by information retrieval tasks. The goal of this workshop is to bring together a community of researchers and practitioners who are interested in using, aligning, and constructing knowledge graphs and similar semantic resources for information retrieval applications.

DE recommender system; gaussian embeddings; probabilistic representation
AB Most collaborative filtering systems, such as matrix factorization, use vector representations for items and users. Those representations are deterministic, and do not allow modeling the uncertainty of the learned representation, which can be useful when a user has a small number of rated items (cold start), or when there is conflicting information about the behavior of a user or the ratings of an item. In this paper, we leverage recent works in learning Gaussian embeddings for the recommendation task. We show that this model performs well on three representative collections (Yahoo, Yelp and MovieLens) and analyze learned representations.

AB One of the primary ways researchers have characterized engagement during information search is by increases in search behaviors, such as queries and clicks. However, studies have shown that frustration is also characterized by increases in these same behaviors. This research examines the differences in the search behaviors and physiologies of people who are engaged or frustrated during search. A 2x2 within-subject laboratory experiment was conducted with 40 participants. Engagement was induced by manipulating task interest and frustration was induced by manipulating the quality of the search results. Participants' interactions and physiological responses were recorded, and after they searched, they evaluated their levels of engagement, frustration and stress. Participants reported significantly greater levels of engagement when completing tasks that interested them and significantly less engagement during searches with poor results quality. For all search behaviors measured, only two significant differences were found according to task interest: participants had more scrolls and longer query intervals when searching for interesting tasks, suggesting greater interaction with content. Significant differences were found for nine behaviors according to results quality, including queries issued, number of SERPs displayed and number of SERP clicks, suggesting these are potentially better indicators of frustration rather than engagement. When presented with poor quality results, participants had significantly higher heart rates than when presented with normal quality results. Finally, participants had lower heart rates and greater skin conductance responses when conducting interesting tasks than when conducting uninteresting tasks. This research provides insight into the differences in search behaviors and physiologies of participants when they are engaged versus frustrated and presents techniques that can be used by those wishing to induce engagement and frustration during laboratory IIR studies.

AB We demonstrate BIONEX, a system to mine, rank and visualize biomedical news events. BIONEX takes biomedical queries such as "Ebola virus disease" and retrieves the k most relevant news events for them. To achieve this we first mine the generic news events by clustering them on a daily basis using general named entities and textual features. These clusters are also tagged with disambiguated biomedical entities which aid in biomedical news event exploration. These clusters are then used to compute the importance scores for the event clusters based on a combination of textual, semantic, popularity and historical importance features. BIONEX also visualizes the retrieved event clusters to highlight the top news events and corresponding news articles for the given query. The visualization also provides the context for news events using (1) a chain of historically relevant news event clusters, and (2) other non-biomedical events from the same day.

AB We present a novel unsupervised query-focused multi-document summarization approach. To this end, we generate a summary by extracting a subset of sentences using the Cross-Entropy (CE) Method. The proposed approach is generic and requires no domain knowledge. Using an evaluation over DUC 2005-2007 datasets with several other state-of-the-art baseline methods, we demonstrate that, our approach is both effective and efficient.

DE LAMBDAMART; learning to rank; user dynamic
AB Ranking query results effectively by considering user past behaviour and preferences is a primary concern for IR researchers both in academia and industry. In this context, LtR is widely believed to be the most effective solution to design ranking models that account for user-interaction features that have proved to remarkably impact on IR effectiveness. In this paper, we explore the possibility of integrating the user dynamic directly into the LtR algorithms. Specifically, we model with Markov chains the behaviour of users in scanning a ranked result list and we modify LAMBDAMART, a state-of-the-art LtR algorithm, to exploit a new discount loss function calibrated on the proposed Markovian model of user dynamic. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on publicly available LtR datasets, finding that the improvements measured over the standard algorithm are statistically significant.

DE Speech Retrieval; Entity Linking; Knowledge Base
AB Searching conversational speech poses several new challenges, among which is how the searcher will make sense of what they find. This paper describes our initial experiments with a freely available collection of Enron telephone conversations. Our goal is to help the user make sense of search results by finding information about mentioned people, places and organizations. Because automated entity recognition is not yet sufficiently accurate on conversational telephone speech, we ask the user to transcribe just the name, and to indicate where in the recording it was heard. We then seek to link that mention to other mentions of the same entity in a variety of sources (in our experiments, in email and in Wikipedia). We cast this as an entity linking problem, and achieve promising results by utilizing social network features to help compensate for the limited accuracy of automatic transcription for this challenging content.

DE IR start-ups; Enterprise search; Industry experience
AB Twenty years ago, I fell into the trap of believing that good performance on TREC Ad Hoc could be turned into commercial success via an enterprise search (ES) start-up. Although we achieved a measure of success, the reality was very different from my expectations. It turned out that end-users cared about search relevance only to the extent of reaching for buckets of vitriol when search failed to find what they wanted, and people making purchasing decisions were more interested in other things: what repositories can be included in the search, how responsive search is to updates, what security models are provided, the appearance of the search pages, and achieving internal business goals even at the expense of end-user needs. Organizations often purchase search technology as part of another system, such as a content management system, or a records management system, leaving other repositories unsearchable or incompatibly searchable. Causes of enterprise search failure include dimensions studied in IR but an ES system often fails because of the way it is configured, or because it fails to cover information resources that end-users need. The dream of a comprehensive, highly relevant, fully secure single search interface to all of an organization's information is very rarely achieved. There is a huge market potential for a killer ES product but the biggest challenges in exploiting it lie outside the scope of IR research.
   I look forward to sharing lessons learned from attempting to commercialize IR technology, and new perspectives from my current employment at Bing.

DE Mail search; Query Auto Completion; Query Suggestion
AB Recent research studies on mail search have shown that the longer the query, the better the quality of results, yet a majority of mail queries remain very short and searchers struggle with formulating queries. A known mechanism to assist users in this task is query auto-completion, which has been highly successful in Web search, where it leverages huge logs of queries issued by hundreds of millions of users. This approach cannot be applied directly to mail search as personal query logs are small, mailboxes are not shared and other users' queries are not necessarily generalizable to all. We therefore propose here to leverage the mailbox content in order to generate suggestions, taking advantage of mail-specific features. We then compare this approach to a recent study that augments an individual user's mail search history with query logs from "similar users", where the similarity is driven by demographics. Finally we show how combining both types of approaches allows for better suggestions quality but also increases the chance that the desired message be retrieved. We validate our claims via a manual qualitative evaluation and large scale quantitative experiments conducted on the query log of Yahoo Mail.

DE Fine-grained Sketch-based Image Retrieval (Fine-grained SBIR); Deep
   Multimodal Embedding; Multimodal Ranking Loss
AB Fine-grained Sketch-based Image Retrieval (Fine-grained SBIR), which uses hand-drawn sketches to search the target object images, has been an emerging topic over the last few years. The difficulties of this task not only come from the ambiguous and abstract characteristics of sketches with less useful information, but also the cross-modal gap at both visual and semantic level. However, images on the web are always exhibited with multimodal contents. In this paper, we consider Fine-grained SBIR as a cross-modal retrieval problem and propose a deep multimodal embedding model that exploits all the beneficial multimodal information sources in sketches and images. In our experiment with large quantity of public data, we show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for Fine-grained SBIR.

ID INFLUENCE MAXIMIZATION; CONTAGION
AB How do we create content that will become viral in a whole network after we share it with friends or followers? Significant research activity has been dedicated to the problem of strategically selecting a seed set of initial adopters so as to maximize a meme's spread in a network. This line of work assumes that the success of such a campaign depends solely on the choice of a tunable seed set of adopters, while the way users perceive the propagated meme is fixed. Yet, in many real-world settings, the opposite holds: a meme's propagation depends on users' perceptions of its tunable characteristics, while the set of initiators is fixed.
   In this paper, we address the natural problem that arises in such circumstances: Suggest content, expressed as a limited set of attributes, for a creative promotion campaign that starts out from a given seed set of initiators, so as to maximize its expected spread over a social network. To our knowledge, no previous work addresses this problem. Wefind that the problem is NP-hard and inapproximable. As a tight approximation guarantee is not admissible, we design an efficient heuristic, Explore-Update, as well as a conventional Greedy solution. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Explore-Update selects near-optimal attribute sets with real data, achieves 30% higher spread than baselines, and runs an order of magnitude faster than the Greedy solution.

DE open source repository; repository recommendation; user programming
   language preference; manifold regularization
AB Social coding and open source repositories have become more and more popular. Software developers have various alternatives to contribute themselves to the communities and collaborate with others. However, nowadays there is no effective recommender suggesting developers appropriate repositories in both the academia and the industry. Although existing one-class collaborative filtering (OCCF) approaches can be applied to this problem, they do not consider particular constraints of social coding such as the programming languages, which, to some extent, associate the repositories with the developers. The aim of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of leveraging user programming language preference to improve the performance of OCCF-based repository recommendation. Based on matrix factorization, we propose language-regularized matrix factorization (LRMF), which is regularized by the relationships between user programming language preferences. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the real-world dataset of GitHub. The results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms five competitive baselines.

AB Machine learning plays a role in many aspects of modern IR systems, and deep learning is applied in all of them. The fast pace of modern-day research has given rise to many different approaches for many different IR problems. The amount of information available can be overwhelming both for junior students and for experienced researchers looking for new research topics and directions.

DE streams; recommender system; multi-dimensional benchmarking
AB Recommender System research has evolved to focus on developing algorithms capable of high performance in online systems. This development calls for a new evaluation infrastructure that supports multi-dimensional evaluation of recommender systems. Today's researchers should analyze algorithms with respect to a variety of aspects including predictive performance and scalability. Researchers need to subject algorithms to realistic conditions in online A/B tests. We introduce two resources supporting such evaluation methodologies: the new data set of stream recommendation interactions released for CLEF NewsREEL 2017, and the new Open Recommendation Platform (ORP). The data set allows researchers to study a stream recommendation problem closely by "replaying" it locally, and ORP makes it possible to take this evaluation "live" in a living lab scenario. Specifically, ORP allows researchers to deploy their algorithms in a live stream to carry out A/B tests. To our knowledge, NewsREEL is the first online news recommender system resource to be put at the disposal of the research community. In order to encourage others to develop comparable resources for a wide range of domains, we present a list of practical lessons learned in the development of the dataset and ORP.

AB This paper investigates how automated query generation methods can be used to derive effective ad-hoc queries from verbose patient narratives. In a clinical setting, automatic query generation provides a means of retrieving information relevant to a clinician, based on a patient record, but without the need for the clinician to manually author a query. Given verbose patient narratives, we evaluated a number of query reduction methods, both generic and domain specific. Comparison was made against human generated queries, both in terms of retrieval effectiveness and characteristics of human queries. Query reduction was an effective means of generating ad-hoc queries from narratives. However, human generated queries were still significantly more effective than automatically generated queries. Further improvements were possible if parameters of the query reduction methods were set on a per-query basis and a means of predicting this was developed. Under ideal conditions, automated methods can exceed humans. Effective human queries were found to contain many novel keywords not found in the narrative. Automated reduction methods may be handicapped in that they only use terms from narrative. Future work, therefore, may be directed toward better understanding effective human queries and automated query rewriting methods that attempt to model the inference of novel terms by exploiting semantic inference processes.

AB Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the practice of making clinical decisions based on rigorous scientific evidence. EBM relies on effective access to peer-reviewed literature a task hampered by both the exponential growth of medical literature and a lack of efficient and effective means of searching and presenting this literature. This paper describes a search engine specifically designed for searching medical literature for the purpose of EBM and in a clinical decision support setting.

DE Learning to Rank; evaluation; analysis
AB In this demo paper we propose RankEval, an open-source tool for the analysis and evaluation of Learning-to-Rank (LtR) models based on ensembles of regression trees. Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) is a flexible statistical learning technique for classification and regression at the state of the art for training effective LtR solutions. Indeed, the success of GBRT fostered the development of several open-source LtR libraries targeting efficiency of the learning phase and effectiveness of the resulting models. However, these libraries offer only very limited help for the tuning and evaluation of the trained models. In addition, the implementations provided for even the most traditional IR evaluation metrics differ from library to library, thus making the objective evaluation and comparison between trained models a difficult task. RankEval addresses these issues by providing a common ground for LtR libraries that offers useful and interoperable tools for a comprehensive comparison and in-depth analysis of ranking models.

DE test collection; Web corpus; search evaluation
AB Web collection is essential for many Web based researches such as Web Information Retrieval (IR), Web data mining, Corpus linguistics and so on. However, it is usually expensive and time-consuming to collect a large scale of Web pages in lab-based environment and public-available collection becomes a necessity for these researches. In this study, we present a Chinese Web collection, SogouT-16, which is the largest free-of-charge public Chinese Web collection so far. We provide a variety of descriptive characteristics of SogouT-16 and discuss its adoption in a newly-designed ad-hoc retrieval task in NTCIR-13, We Want Web. SogouT-16 also provides online retrieval service and contains a number of auxiliary resources including hyperlink structure graph, query logs, word embedding, and etc. We believe that SogouT-16 will provide new opportunities for novel investigations and applications in IR and other related communities.

   document ranking
AB We present one of the world's first attempts to examine the feasibility of multileaving evaluation of document rankings on a large scale commercial community Question Answering (cQA) service. As a natural enhancement of interleaving evaluation, multileaving merges more than two input rankings into one and measures the search user satisfaction of each input ranking on the basis of user clicks on the multileaved ranking. We evaluated the adequateness of two major multileaving methods, team draft multileaving (TDM) and optimized multileaving (OM), proposing their practical implementation for live services. Our experimental results demonstrated that multileaving methods could precisely evaluate the effectiveness of five rankings with different quality by using clicks from real users. Moreover, we concluded that OM is more efficient than TDM by observing that most of the evaluation results with OM converged after showing multileaved rankings around 40,000 times and an in-depth analysis of their characteristics.

AB The design and presentation of a Search Engine Results Page (SERP) has been subject to much research. With many contemporary aspects of the SERP now under scrutiny, work still remains in investigating more traditional SERP components, such as the result summary. Prior studies have examined a variety of different aspects of result summaries, but in this paper we investigate the influence of result summary length on search behaviour, performance and user experience. To this end, we designed and conducted a within subjects experiment using the TREC AQUAINT news collection with 53 participants. Using Kullback-Leibler distance as a measure of information gain, we examined result summaries of different lengths and selected four conditions where the change in information gain was the greatest: (i) title only; (ii) title plus one snippet; (iii) title plus two snippets; and (iv) title plus four snippets. Findings show that participants broadly preferred longer result summaries, as they were perceived to be more informative. However, their performance in terms of correctly identifying relevant documents was similar across all four conditions. Furthermore, while the participants felt that longer summaries were more informative, empirical observations suggest otherwise; while participants were more likely to click on relevant items given longer summaries, they also were more likely to click on non-relevant items. This shows that longer is not necessarily better, though participants perceived that to be the case and second, they reveal a positive relationship between the length and informativeness of summaries and their attractiveness (i.e. clickthrough rates). These findings show that there are tensions between perception and performance when designing result summaries that need to be taken into account.

AB Freedom of Information (FOI) laws legislate that government documents should be opened to the public. However, many government documents contain sensitive information, such as confidential information, that is exempt from release. Therefore, government documents must be sensitivity reviewed prior to release, to identify and close any sensitive information. With the adoption of born-digital documents, such as email, there is a need for automatic sensitivity classification to assist digital sensitivity review. SVM classifiers and Part-of-Speech sequences have separately been shown to be promising for sensitivity classification. However, sequence classfication methodologies, and specifically SVM kernel functions, have not been fully investigated for sensitivity classification. Therefore, in this work, we present an evaluation of five SVM kernel functions for sensitivity classification using POS sequences. Moreover, we show that an ensemble classifier that combines POS sequence classification with text classification can significantly improve sensitivity classification effectiveness (+6.09% F-2) compared with a text classification baseline, according to McNemar's test of significance.

DE Term proximity; term position; axiomatic analysis; pseudo-relevance
   feedback; query expansion
AB Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) refers to a query expansion strategy based on top-retrieved documents, which has been shown to be highly effective in many retrieval models. Previous work has introduced a set of constraints (axioms) that should be satisfied by any PRF model. In this paper, we propose three additional constraints based on the proximity of feedback terms to the query terms in the feedback documents. As a case study, we consider the log-logistic model, a state-of-the-art PRF model that has been proven to be a successful method in satisfying the existing PRF constraints, and show that it does not satisfy the proposed constraints. We further modify the log-logistic model based on the proposed proximity-based constraints. Experiments on four TREC collections demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed constraints. Our modification to the log-logistic model leads to significant and substantial (up to 15%) improvements. Furthermore, we show that the proposed proximity-based function outperforms the well-known Gaussian kernel which does not satisfy all the proposed constraints.

AB Patent engineers are spending significant time analyzing patent claim structures to grasp the range of technology covered or to compare similar patents in the same patent family. Though patent claims are the most important section in a patent, it is hard for a human to examine them. In this paper, we propose an information-extraction-based technique to grasp the patent claim structure. We confirmed that our approach is promising through empirical evaluation of entity mention extraction and the relation extraction method. We also built a preliminary interface to visualize patent structures, compare patents, and search similar patents.

AB Many websites offer promotions in terms of bundled items that can be purchased together, usually at a discounted rate. 'Bundling' may be a means of increasing sales revenue, but may also be a means for content creators to expose users to new items that they may not have considered in isolation. In this paper, we seek to understand the semantics of what constitutes a 'good' bundle, in order to recommend existing bundles to users on the basis of their constituent products, as well the more diffcult task of generating new bundles that are personalized to a user. To do so we collect a new dataset from the Steam video game distribution platform, which is unique in that it contains both 'traditional' recommendation data (rating and purchase histories between users and items), as well as bundle purchase information. We assess issues such as bundle size and item compatibility, and show that these features, when combined with traditional matrix factorization techniques, can lead to highly effective bundle recommendation and generation.

DE Cross-Device User Linking; Entity Resolution
AB Cross-Device User Linking is the task of detecting same users given their browsing logs on different devices (e.g., tablet, mobile phone, PC, etc.). The problem was introduced in CIKM Cup 2016 together with a new dataset provided by Data-Centric Alliance (DCA). In this paper, we present insightful analysis on the dataset and propose a solution to link users based on their visited URLs, visiting time, and profile embeddings. We cast the problem as pairwise classification and use gradient boosting as the leaning-to-rank model. Our model works on a set of features exacted from URLs, titles, time and session data derived from user device-logs. The model outperforms the best solution in the CIKM Cup by a large margin.

DE Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Models; Information Retrieval and Search
   Ranking
AB Job Search is a core product at Linkedln which makes it essential to generate highly relevant search results when a user searches for jobs on Linkedin. Historically job results were ranked using linear models consisting of a combination of user, job and query features. This paper talks about a new generalized mixed effect models introduced in the context of ranking candidate job results for a job search performed on Linkedln. We build a per-query model which is populated with coefficients corresponding to job-features in addition to the existing global model features. We describe the details of the new method along with the challenges faced in launching such a model into production and making it efficient at a very large scale. Our experiments show improvement over previous baseline ranking models, in terms of offline metrics (both AUC and NDCG@K metrics) as well as online metrics in production (Job Applies) which are of interest to us. The resulting method is more powerful and has also been adopted in other applications at Linkedln successfully.

AB Using classical statistical significance tests, researchers can only discuss P (D 1H), the probability of observing the data D at hand or something more extreme, under the assumption that the hypothesis H is true (i.e., the p-value). But what we usually want is P(111D), the probability that a hypothesis is true, given the data. If we use Bayesian statistics with state-of-the-art Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for obtaining posterior distributions, this is no longer a problem. That is, instead of the classical p-values and 95% confidence intervals, which are often misinterpreted respectively as "probability that the hypothesis is (in)correct" and "probability that the true parameter value drops within the interval is 95%:' we can easily obtain P(111D) and credible intervals which represent exactly the above. Moreover, with Bayesian tests, we can easily handle virtually any hypothesis, not just "equality of means," and obtain an Expected A Posteriori (EAP) value of any statistic that we are interested in. We provide simple tools to encourage the IR community to take up paired and unpaired Bayesian tests for comparing two systems. Using a variety of TREC and NTCIR data, we compare P(111D) with p-values, credible intervals with confidence intervals, and Bayesian EAP effect sizes with classical ones. Our results show that (a) p-values and confidence intervals can respectively be regarded as approximations of what we really want, namely, P(111D) and credible intervals; and (b) sample effect sizes from classical significance tests can differ considerably from the Bayesian EAP effect sizes, which suggests that the former can be poor estimates of population effect sizes. For both paired and unpaired tests, we propose that the IR community report the EAP, the credible interval, and the probability of hypothesis being true, not only for the raw difference in means but also for the effect size in terms of Glass's A.

DE Entity-Relationship Retrieval
AB Improvements of entity-relationship (E-R) search techniques have been hampered by a lack of test collections, particularly for complex queries involving multiple entities and relationships. In this paper we describe a method for generating E-R test queries to support comprehensive E-R search experiments. Queries and relevance judgments are created from content that exists in a tabular form where columns represent entity types and the table structure implies one or more relationships among the entities. Editorial work involves creating natural language queries based on relationships represented by the entries in the table. We have publicly released the RELink test collection comprising 600 queries and relevance judgments obtained from a sample of Wikipedia List-of-lists-of-lists tables. The latter comprise tuples of entities that are extracted from columns and labelled by corresponding entity types and relationships they represent. In order to facilitate research in complex E-R retrieval, we have created and released as open source the RELink Framework that includes Apache Lucene indexing and search specifically tailored to E-R retrieval. RELink includes entity and relationship indexing based on the ClueWeb-09-BWeb collection with FACC1 text span annotations linked to Wikipedia entities. With ready to use search resources and a comprehensive test collection, we support community in pursuing E-R research at scale.

   query into keyword query; Neural machine translation
AB The number of natural language queries submitted to search engines is increasing as search environments get diversified. However, legacy search engines are still optimized for short keyword queries. Thus, the use of natural language queries at legacy search engines degrades the retrieval performance of the engines. This paper proposes a novel method to translate a natural language query into a keyword query relevant to the natural language query for retrieving better search results without change of the engines. The proposed method formulates the translation as a generation task. That is, the method generates a keyword query from a natural language query by preserving the semantics of the natural language query. A recurrent neural network encoder-decoder architecture is adopted as a generator of keyword queries from natural language queries. In addition, an attention mechanism is also used to cope with long natural language queries.

DE Text Stream; Real-Time Pushing; Deep Reinforcement Learning
AB The massive amount of noisy and redundant information in text streams makes it a challenge for users to acquire timely and relevant information in social media. Real-time notification pushing on text stream is of practical importance. In this paper, we formulate the real-time pushing on text stream as a sequential decision making problem and propose a Neural Network based Reinforcement Learning (NNRL) algorithm for real-time decision making, e.g., push or skip the incoming text, with considering both history dependencies and future uncertainty. A novel Q-Network which contains a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer and three fully connected neural network layers is designed to maximize the long-term rewards. Experiment results on the real data from TREC 2016 Real-time Sum-marization track show that our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

DE User Behavior; Survival Analysis; Dwell Time; Session Length
AB Session length is a very important aspect in determining a user's satisfaction with a media streaming service. Being able to predict how long a session will last can be of great use for various downstream tasks, such as recommendations and ad scheduling. Most of the related literature on user interaction duration has focused on dwell time for websites, usually in the context of approximating post-click satisfaction either in search results, or display ads.
   In this work we present the first analysis of session length in a mobile-focused online service, using a real world data-set from a major music streaming service. We use survival analysis techniques to show that the characteristics of the length distributions can differ significantly between users, and use gradient boosted trees with appropriate objectives to predict the length of a session using only information available at its beginning. Our evaluation on real world data illustrates that our proposed technique outperforms the considered baseline.

DE Proactive information retrieval; Screen surveillance; User modeling
AB We demonstrate proactive information retrieval via screen surveillance. A user's digital activities are continuously monitored by capturing all content on a user's screen using optical character recognition. This includes all applications and services being exploited and relies on each individual user's computer usage, such as their Web browsing, emails, instant messaging, and word processing. Topic modeling is then applied to detect the user's topical activity context to retrieve information. We demonstrate a system that proactively retrieves information from a user's activity history being observed on the screen when the user is performing unseen activities on a personal computer. We report an evaluation with ten participants that shows high user satisfaction and retrieval effectiveness. Our demonstration and experimental results show that surveillance of a user's screen can be used to build an extremely rich model of a user's digital activities across application boundaries and enable effective proactive information retrieval.

DE Mobile social networks; digital footprint; social relationship
   formation; mobility model; social network analysis
AB In this paper we aim at addressing the correlation between two critical factors in mobile social networks (MSNs): the social-relationship networking among users and the spatial mobility pattern of users. Specifically, we investigate the impact of users' spatial distribution on their social relationship formation in MSNs. Based on the geolocation data (check-in records) and social relation data of MSN users, we propose a model, called neighborhood-cardinality-based model (NCBM), to describe this impact by taking into account both the multiple home-points/hotspots property of spatial mobility and the long-tailed social relationship degree distribution of MSN users. We define a fundamental quantity for each user, i.e., the so-called neighborhood cardinality, to measure how many and how often other MSN users visit his nearby area with a given range. Tine core of NCBM is a principle: The probability that a user, say u, is followed by another user, say v, obeys a power law distribution of the neighborhood cardinality of user u. The proposed formation model is evaluated on two large check-in datasets: Brightkite and Gowalla. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed formation model provides a useful paradigm for capturing the correlation between MSN users' mobility patterns and social relationships.

DE Aspect-based sentiment analysis; review mining; personalization
AB We develop an aspect-based sentiment analysis system named ReviewMiner. It analyzes opinions expressed about an entity in an online review at the level of topical aspects to discover each individual reviewer's latent opinion on each aspect as well as his/her relative emphasis on different aspects when forming the overall judgment of the entity. The system personalizes the retrieved results according to users' input preferences over the identified aspects, recommends similar items based on the detailed aspect-level opinions, and summarizes aspect-level opinions in textual, temporal and spatial dimensions. The unique multi-modal opinion summarization and visualization mechanisms provide users with rich perspectives to digest information from user-generated opinionated content for making informed decisions.

DE sentiment classification; sentence-level; weak supervision
AB Sentence-level sentiment classification is important to understand users' fine-grained opinions. Existing methods for sentence-level sentiment classification are mainly based on supervised learning. However, it is difficult to obtain sentiment labels of sentences since manual annotation is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an approach for sentence-level sentiment classification without the need of sentence labels. More specifically, we propose a unified framework to incorporate two types of weak supervision, i.e., document-level and word-level sentiment labels, to learn the sentence-level sentiment classifier. In addition, the contextual information of sentences and words extracted from unlabeled sentences is incorporated into our approach to enhance the learning of sentiment classifier. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach can effectively improve the performance of sentence-level sentiment classification.

DE Response generation; Domain adaptation; Reinforcement learning
AB In this paper, we propose a novel personalized response generation model via domain adaptation (PRG-DM). First, we learn the human responding style from large general data (without user-specific information). Second, we fine tune the model on a small size of personalized data to generate personalized responses with a dual learning mechanism. Moreover, we propose three new rewards to characterize good conversations that are personalized, informative and grammatical. We employ the policy gradient method to generate highly rewarded responses. Experimental results show that our model can generate better personalized responses for different users.

DE Clustering; crowdsourcing; inference; label aggregation
AB This paper proposes a novel general label aggregation method for both binary and multi-class labeling in crowdsourcing, namely Bi-Layer Clustering (BLC), which clusters two layers of features - the conceptual-level and the physical-level features - to infer true labels of instances. BLC first clusters the instances using the conceptual-level features extracted from their multiple noisy labels and then performs clustering again using the physical-level features. It can facilitate tracking the uncertainty changes of the instances, so that the integrated labels that are likely to be falsely inferred on the conceptual layer can be easily corrected using the estimated labels on the physical layer. Experimental results on two real-world crowdsourcing data sets show that BLC outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods.

AB Push notification is a key component for E-commerce mobile applications, which has been extensively used for user growth and engagement. The effectiveness of the push notification is generally measured by message open rate. A push message can contain a recommended product, a shopping news and etc., but often only one or two items can be shown in the push message due to the limit of display space. This paper proposes a mixture model approach for predicting push message open rate for a post-purchase complementary product recommendation task. The mixture model is trained to learn latent prediction contexts, which are determined by user and item profiles, and then make open rate predictions accordingly. The item with the highest predicted open rate is then chosen to be included in the push notification message for each user. The parameters of the mixture model are optimized using an EM algorithm. A set of experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method live with a popular E-Commerce mobile app. The results show that the proposed method is superior than several existing solutions by a significant margin.

DE POI suggestion; network representation
AB With the rapid development of mobile devices, point-of-interest (POI) suggestion has become a popular online web service, which provides attractive and interesting locations to users. In order to provide interesting POIs, many existing POI recommendation works learn the latent representations of users and POIs from users' past visiting POIs, which suffers from the sparsity problem of POI data. In this paper, we consider the problem of POI suggestion from the viewpoint of learning geosocial multimedia network representations. We propose a novel max-margin metric geosocial multimedia network representation learning framework by exploiting users' check-in behavior and their social relations. We then develop a random-walk based learning method with max-margin metric network embedding. We evaluate the performance of our method on a large-scale geosocial multimedia network dataset and show that our method achieves the best performance than other state-of-the-art solutions.

DE Tweet Recommendation; Content and Network Analysis
AB With the rapid proliferation of microblogging services such as Twitter, a large number of tweets is published everyday often making users feel overwhelmed with information. Helping these users to discover potentially interesting tweets is an important task for such services. In this paper, we present a novel tweet-recommendation approach, which exploits network, content, and retweet analyses for making recommendations of tweets. The idea is to recommend tweets that are not visible to the user (i.e., they do not appear in the user timeline) because nobody in her social circles published or retweeted them. To do that, we create the user's ego-network up to depth two and apply the transitivity property of the friends-of-friends relationship to determine interesting recommendations, which are then ranked to best match the user's interests. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves the state-of-the-art technique.

DE Privacy Risk Assessment; Online Communities
AB Privacy of Internet users is at stake because they expose personal information in posts created in online communities, in search queries, and other activities. An adversary that monitors a community may identify the users with the most sensitive properties and utilize this knowledge against them (e.g., by adjusting the pricing of goods or targeting ads of sensitive nature). Existing privacy models for structured data are inadequate to capture privacy risks from user posts.
   This paper presents a ranking-based approach to the assessment of privacy risks emerging from textual contents in online communities, focusing on sensitive topics, such as being depressed. We propose ranking as a means of modeling a rational adversary who targets the most afflicted users. To capture the adversary's background knowledge regarding vocabulary and correlations, we use latent topic models. We cast these considerations into the new model of R-Susceptibility, which can inform and alert users about their potential for being targeted, and devise measures for quantitative risk assessment. Experiments with real-world data show the feasibility of our approach.

DE focused relevance feedback
AB We present a novel study of ad hoc retrieval methods utilizing document-level relevance feedback and/or focused relevance feedback; namely, passages marked as (non-)relevant. The first method uses a novel mixture model that integrates relevant and non-relevant information at the language model level. The second method fuses retrieval scores produced by using relevant and non-relevant information separately. Empirical exploration attests to the merits of our methods, and sheds light on the effectiveness of using and integrating relevance feedback for textual units of varying granularities.

DE burst detection; real-time tracking; twitter
AB This work presents RTTBurst, an end-to-end system for ingesting descriptions of user interest profiles and discovering new and relevant tweets based on those interest profiles using a simple model for identifying bursts in token usage. Our approach differs from standard retrieval-based techniques in that it primarily focuses on identifying noteworthy moments in the tweet stream, and "summarizes" those moments using selected tweets. We lay out the architecture of RTTBurst, our participation in and performance at the TREC 2015 Microblog track, and a method for combining and potentially improving existing TREC systems. Official results and post hoc experiments show that our simple targeted burst detection technique is competitive with existing systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our burst detection mechanism can be used to improve the performance of other systems for the same task.

DE Carpooling; rides search; ranking
AB COMEWITHME is an activity oriented carpooling service that enlarges the candidate destinations of a ride request by considering alternative places where the desired activity can be performed. It is based on the observation that individuals often move towards a place to perform an activity while the activity is often not strictly associated with a single place, as one may go for shopping or eating to many different locations. Activity-oriented carpooling hugely increases the number of rides matching a query, thus introducing requirements on system responsiveness and ranking effectiveness that are not common to traditional carpooling services. The demoed system implements the COMEWITHME service in almost its entirety, and includes the back-end and a user-friendly mobile application for smart-phones aimed at achieving users' acceptance and usability.

AB Topic modelling approaches help scholars to examine the topics discussed in a corpus. Due to the popularity of Twitter, two distinct methods have been proposed to accommodate the brevity of tweets: the tweet pooling method and Twitter LDA. Both of these methods demonstrate a higher performance in producing more interpretable topics than the standard Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) when applied on tweets. However, while various metrics have been proposed to estimate the coherence of the generated topics from tweets, the coherence of the top ranked topics, those that are most likely to be examined by users, has not been investigated. In addition, the effect of the number of generated topics K on the topic coherence scores has not been studied. In this paper, we conduct large-scale experiments using three topic modelling approaches over two Twitter datasets, and apply a state-of-the-art coherence metric to study the coherence of the top ranked topics and how K affects such coherence. Inspired by ranking metrics such as precision at n, we use coherence at n to assess the coherence of a topic model. To verify our results, we conduct a pairwise user study to obtain human preferences over topics. Our findings are threefold: we find evidence that Twitter LDA outperforms both LDA and the tweet pooling method because the top ranked topics it generates have more coherence; we demonstrate that a larger number of topics (K) helps to generate topics with more coherence; and finally, we show that coherence at n is more effective when evaluating the coherence of a topic model than the average coherence score.

AB LinkedIn search is deeply personalized - for the same queries, different searchers expect completely different results. This paper presents our approach to achieving this by mining various data sources available in LinkedIn to infer searchers' intents (such as hiring, job seeking, etc.), as well as extending the concept of homophily to capture the searcher-result similarities on many aspects. Then, learning-to-rank is applied to combine these signals with standard search features.

AB Focused retrieval (a.k.a., passage retrieval) is important at its own right and as an intermediate step in question answering systems. We present a new Web-based collection for focused retrieval. The document corpus is the Category A of the ClueWeb12 collection. Forty-nine queries from the educational domain were created. The 100 documents most highly ranked for each query by a highly effective learning-to-rank method were judged for relevance using crowdsourcing. All sentences in the relevant documents were judged for relevance.

AB In this paper, we propose SimCC-AT (similarity based on content and citations with automatic parameter tuning) to compute the similarity of scientific papers. As in SimCC, the state-of-the-art method, we exploit a notion of a contribution score in similarity computation. SimCC-AT utilizes an automatic weighting scheme based on SVMrank and thus requires only a smaller number of experiments for parameter tuning than SimCC. Furthermore, our experimental results with a real-world dataset show that the accuracy of SimCC-AT is dramatically higher than that of other existing methods and is comparable to that of SimCC.

AB In recent years, studies about trend detection in online social media streams have begun to emerge. Since not all users are likely to always be interested in the same set of trends, some of the research also focused on personalizing the trends by using some predefined personalized context. In this paper, we take this problem further to a setting in which the user's context is not predefined, but rather determined as the user issues a query. This presents a new challenge since trends cannot be computed ahead of time using high latency algorithms. We present RT-Trend, an online trend detection algorithm that promptly finds relevant in-context trends as users issue search queries over a dataset of documents. We evaluate our approach using real data from an online social network by assessing its ability to predict actual activity increase of social network entities in the context of a search result. Since we implemented this feature into an existing tool with an active pool of users, we also report click data, which suggests positive feedback.

AB Here we propose an advance Skip-gram model to incorporate both word sentiment and negation information. In particular, there is a a softmax layer for the word sentiment polarity upon the Skip-gram model. Then, two paralleled embedding layers are set up in the same embedding space, one for the affirmative context and the other for the negated context, followed by their loss functions. We evaluate our proposed model on the 2013 and 2014 SemEval data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves better performance and learns higher dimensional word embedding informatively on the large-scale data.

AB Although the content in scientific publications is increasingly challenging, it is necessary to investigate another important problem, that of scientific information understanding. For this proposed problem, we investigate novel methods to assist scholars (readers) to better understand scientific publications by enabling physical and virtual collaboration. For physical collaboration, an algorithm will group readers together based on their profiles and reading behavior, and will enable the cyberreading collaboration within a online reading group. For virtual collaboration, instead of pushing readers to communicate with others, we cluster readers based on their estimated information needs. For each cluster, a learning to rank model will be generated to recommend readers' communitized resources (i.e., videos, slides, and wikis) to help them understand the target publication.

AB Predicting users' examination of search results is one of the key concerns in Web search related studies. With more and more heterogeneous components federated into search engine result pages (SERPs), it becomes difficult for traditional position-based models to accurately predict users' actual examination patterns. Therefore, a number of prior works investigate the connection between examination and users' explicit interaction behaviors (e.g. click-through, mouse movement). Although these works gain much success in predicting users' examination behavior on SERPs, they require the collection of large scale user behavior data, which makes it impossible to predict examination behavior on newly-generated SERPs. To predict user examination on SERPs containing heterogenous components without user interaction information, we propose a new prediction model based on visual saliency map and page content features. Visual saliency, which is designed to measure the likelihood of a given area to attract human visual attention, is used to predict users' attention distribution on heterogenous search components. With an experimental search engine, we carefully design a user study in which users' examination behavior (eye movement) is recorded. Examination prediction results based on this collected data set demonstrate that visual saliency features significantly improve the performance of examination model in heterogeneous search environments. We also found that saliency features help predict internal examination behavior within vertical results.

DE recommendation; serendipity; Bayesian tensor factorization
AB Computational creativity, as an emerging domain of application, emphasizes the use of big data to automatically design new knowledge. Based on the availability of complex multi-relational data, one aspect of computational creativity is to infer unexplored regions of feature space and novel learning paradigm, which is particularly useful for online recommendation. Tensor models offer effective approaches for complex multi-relational data learning and missing element completion. Targeting at constructing a recommender system that can compromise between accuracy and creativity for users, a deep Bayesian probabilistic tensor framework for tag and item recommending is adopted. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method and indicate that it can better capture latent patterns of interaction relationships and generate interesting recommendations based on creative tag combinations.

DE Academic search; expertise retrieval
AB Expertise retrieval has been the subject of intense research over the past decade, particularly with the public availability of benchmark test collections for expertise retrieval in enterprises. Another domain which has seen comparatively less research on expertise retrieval is academic search. In this paper, we describe the Lattes Expertise Retrieval (LExR) test collection for research on academic expertise retrieval. LExR has been designed to provide a large-scale benchmark for two complementary expertise retrieval tasks, namely, expert profiling and expert finding. Unlike currently available test collections, which fully support only one of these tasks, LExR provides graded relevance judgments performed by expert judges separately for each task. In addition, LExR is both cross -organization and cross -area, encompassing candidate experts from all areas of knowledge working in research institutions all over Brazil. As a result, it constitutes a valuable resource for fostering new research directions on expertise retrieval in an academic setting.

DE Simulation; Search Behavior; Strategy; Stopping Strategies; Continuation
   Strategies; Querying Strategies; User Modeling
AB Simulation provides a powerful and cost-effective approach to explore and evaluate how interactions between a searcher and system influence search behaviour and performance. With a growing interest in simulation and an increasing number of papers using such an approach, there is a need for a flexible framework for simulation. Thus, we present SimIIR, an open-source toolkit for building and conducting Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) experiments. The framework consists of a number of high level components, including the simulation, the searcher and the system, all of which must be configured. The SimIIR framework provides a series of interchangeable components. Examples of these components include the querying strategies ( how simulated queries are formulated) and stopping strategies ( the depth to which a searcher will examine snippets and documents) that a simulated searcher will employ. We have implemented various existing strategies so that they can be used by other researchers to not only replicate and reproduce past experiments, but also create new experiments. This paper describes the SimIIR framework and the different components that can be configured and extended as required.

DE Linking; Event digest; Diversification; Semantic annotations
AB For a general user, easy access to vast amounts of online information available on past events has made retrospection much harder. We propose a problem of automatic event digest generation to aid effective and efficient retrospection. For this, in addition to text, a digest should maximize the reportage of time, geolocations, and entities to present a holistic view on the past event of interest.
   We propose a novel divergence-based framework that selects excerpts from an initial set of pseudo-relevant documents, such that the overall relevance is maximized, while avoiding redundancy in text, time, geolocations, and named entities, by treating them as independent dimensions of an event. Our method formulates the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) for global inference to diversify across the event dimensions. Relevance and redundancy measures are defined based on JS-divergence between independent query and excerpt models estimated for each event dimension. Elaborate experiments on three real-world datasets are conducted to compare our methods against the state-of-the-art from the literature. Using Wikipedia articles as gold standard summaries in our evaluation, we find that the most holistic digest of an event is generated with our method that integrates all event dimensions. We compare all methods using standard Rouge-1, -2, and -SU4 along with Rouge-NP, and a novel weighted variant of Rouge.

AB The accuracy of many classification algorithms is known to suffer when the data are imbalanced (i.e., when the distribution of the examples across the classes is severely skewed). Many applications of binary text classification are of this type, with the positive examples of the class of interest far outnumbered by the negative examples. Oversampling (i.e., generating synthetic training examples of the minority class) is an often used strategy to counter this problem. We present a new oversampling method specifically designed for classifying data (such as text) for which the distributional hypothesis holds, according to which the meaning of a feature is somehow determined by its distribution in large corpora of data. Our Distributional Random Oversampling method generates new random minority-class synthetic documents by exploiting the distributional properties of the terms in the collection. We discuss results we have obtained on the Reuters-21578, OHSUMED-S, and RCV1-v2 datasets.

ID KEYWORD SEARCH
AB Financial and economic data are typically available in the form of tables and comprise mostly of monetary amounts, numeric and other domain-specific fields. They can be very hard to search and they are often made available out of context, or in forms which cannot be integrated with systems where text is required, such as voice-enabled devices.
   This work presents a novel system that enables both experts in the finance domain and non-expert users to search financial data with both keyword and natural language queries. Our system answers the queries with an automatically generated textual description using Natural Language Generation (NLG). The answers are further enriched with derived information, not explicitly asked in the user query, to provide the context of the answer. The system is designed to be flexible in order to accommodate new use cases without significant development effort, thus allowing fast integration of new datasets.

AB This paper presents a method to map user needs and integrate serendipitous search behaviors in search algorithm development: the living lab approach. This user-centered design approach involves technology users during technology development to catch unexpected insights and successfully innovate. This paper focuses on the preliminary findings of a living lab case study to answer the question how this methodology reveals fine-grained information about users' serendipitous search behaviors. The case study involves a specific user group, media professionals who work in broadcast television and use audiovisual archives to create audiovisual content, during the development of new search algorithms for a large audiovisual archive. Research insights are based on data gathered during one co-design workshop, and ten in-depth semi-structured interviews with media professionals.
   Findings stipulate that these users balance socio-technical constraints and affordances during creative retrieval to (1) find exactly what is sought; and (2) increase the possibility of serendipitous, unforeseen search results. We conclude that modeling these search processes in terms of improvising with constraints and affordances enables an effective articulation and channeling of user-technology interaction insights into new technology development. The paper suggests next steps in the living lab approach to further understand serendipitous search and creative retrieval processes.

AB When searching in a document collection by keywords, good auto-completion suggestions can be derived from query logs and corpus statistics. On the other hand, when querying documents which have automatically been linked to entities and semantic categories, auto-completion has not been investigated much. We have developed a semantic auto-completion system, where suggestions for entities and categories are computed in real-time from the context of already entered entities or categories and from entity-level co-occurrence statistics for the underlying corpus. Given the huge size of the knowledge bases that underlie this setting, a challenge is to compute the best suggestions fast enough for interactive user experience. Our demonstration shows the effectiveness of our method, and its interactive usability.

AB Archives are an important source of study for various scholars. Digitization and the web have made archives more accessible and led to the development of several time-aware exploratory search systems. However these systems have been designed for more general users rather than scholars. Scholars have more complex information needs in comparison to general users. They also require support for corpus creation during their exploration process. In this paper we present Expedition - a time-aware exploratory search system that addresses the requirements and information needs of scholars. Expedition possesses a suite of ad-hoc and diversity based retrieval models to address complex information needs; a newspaper-style user interface to allow for larger textual previews and comparisons; entity filters to more naturally refine a result list and an interactive annotated timeline which can be used to better identify periods of importance.

AB This paper describes a new test collection for passage retrieval from multilingual, informal text. The task being modeled is that of a monolingual English-speaking user who wishes to search discussion forum text in a foreign language. The system retrieves relevant short passages of text and presents them to the user, translated into English. The test collection contains more than 2 billion words of discussion thread text, 250 queries representing complex informational search needs, and manual relevance judgments of forum post passages, pooled from real systems. This information retrieval test collection is the first to combine multilingual search, passage retrieval, and informal online genre text.

AB Amazon is one of the world's largest e-commerce sites and Amazon Search powers the majority of Amazon's sales. As a consequence, even small improvements in relevance ranking both positively influence the shopping experience of millions of customers and significantly impact revenue. In the past, Amazon's product search engine consisted of several hand-tuned ranking functions using a handful of input features. A lot has changed since then. In this talk we are going to cover a number of relevance algorithms used in Amazon Search today. We will describe a general machine learning framework used for ranking within categories, blending separate rankings in All Product Search, NLP techniques used for matching queries and products, and algorithms targeted at unique tasks of specific categories - books and fashion.

ID PROBABILISTIC INFERENCE
AB Using approximate inference techniques, we investigate in this paper the applicability of Bayesian Networks to the problem of ranking a large set of documents. Topology of the network is a bipartite. Network parameters (conditional probability distributions) are determined through an adoption of the weighting scheme tf-idf. Rank of a document with respect to a given query is defined as the corresponding posterior probability, which is estimated through performing Rejection Sampling. Experimental results suggest that performance of the model is at least comparable to the baseline ones such as BM25. The framework of this model potentially offers new and novel ways in weighting documents. Integrating the model with other ranking algorithms, meanwhile, is expected to bring in performance improvement in document ranking.

DE Document ranking; Retrieval model; Term weighting
ID MODEL
AB Most of the existing information retrieval models assume that the terms of a text document are independent of each other. These retrieval models integrate three major variables to determine the degree of importance of a term for a document: within document term frequency, document length and the specificity of the term in the collection. Intuitively, the importance of a term for a document is not only dependent on the three aspects mentioned above, but also dependent on the degree of semantic coherence between the term and the document. In this paper, we propose a heuristic approach, in which the degree of semantic coherence of the query terms with a document is adopted to improve the information retrieval performance. Experimental results on standard TREC collections show the proposed models consistently outperform the state-of-the-art models.

DE Aggregated search interfaces; search behavior; cognitive ability
AB While aggregated search interfaces that present vertical results to searchers are fairly common in today's search environments, little is known about how searchers' cognitive abilities impact how they use and evaluate these interfaces. This study evaluates the relationship between two cognitive abilities - perceptual speed and visual memory - and searchers' behaviors and interface preferences when using two aggregated search interfaces: one that blends vertical results into the search results (blended) and one that does not (non-blended). Cognitive tests were administered to sixteen participants who subsequently performed four search tasks using the two interfaces. Participants' search interactions were logged and after searching, they rated the usability, engagement and effectiveness of each interface, as well as made comparative evaluations. Results showed that participants with low perceptual speed spent significantly more time completing tasks when using the blended interface, while those with high perceptual speed spent roughly equivalent amounts of time completing tasks with the two interfaces. Those with low perceptual speed also rated both interfaces as significantly less usable along many measures, and were less satisfied with their searches. There were also main effects for interface: participants rated the non-blended interface significantly more usable than the blended interface.

AB The increased availability of image capturing devices has enabled collections of digital images to rapidly expand in both size and diversity. This has created a constantly growing need for efficient and effective image browsing, searching, and retrieval tools. Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) has proven to be an effective mechanism for improving retrieval accuracy. An original, simple yet effective rank-based PRF mechanism (RB-PRF) that takes into account the initial rank order of each image to improve retrieval accuracy is proposed. This RB-PRF mechanism innovates by making use of binary image signatures to improve retrieval precision by promoting images similar to highly ranked images and demoting images similar to lower ranked images. Empirical evaluations based on standard benchmarks, namely Wang, Oliva & Torralba, and Corel datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RB-PRF mechanism in image retrieval.

AB For intrinsically diverse tasks, in which collecting extensive information from different aspects of a topic is required, searchers often have difficulty formulating queries to explore diverse aspects and deciding when to stop searching. With the goal of helping searchers discover unexplored aspects and find the appropriate timing for search stopping in intrinsically diverse tasks, we propose ScentBar, a query suggestion interface visualizing the amount of important information that a user potentially misses collecting from the search results of individual queries. We define the amount of missed information for a query as the additional gain that can be obtained from unclicked search results of the query, where gain is formalized as a set-wise metric based on aspect importance, aspect novelty, and per-aspect document relevance and is estimated by using a stateof- the-art algorithm for subtopic mining and search result diversification. Results of a user study involving 24 participants showed that the proposed interface had the following advantages when the gain estimation algorithm worked reasonably: (1) ScentBar users stopped examining search results after collecting a greater amount of relevant information; (2) they issued queries whose search results contained more missed information; (3) they obtained higher gain, particularly at the late stage of their sessions; and (4) they obtained higher gain per unit time. These results suggest that the simple query visualization helps make the search process of intrinsically diverse tasks more efficient, unless inaccurate estimates of missed information are visualized.

   Estimation
AB The Kendall tau and AP rank correlation coefficients have become mainstream in Information Retrieval research for comparing the rankings of systems produced by two different evaluation conditions, such as different effectiveness measures or pool depths. However, in this paper we focus on the expected rank correlation between the mean scores observed with a test collection and the true, unobservable means under the same conditions. In particular, we propose statistical estimators of tau and AP correlations following both parametric and non-parametric approaches, and with special emphasis on small topic sets. Through large scale simulation with TREC data, we study the error and bias of the estimators. In general, such estimates of expected correlation with the true ranking may accompany the results reported from an evaluation experiment, as an easy to understand figure of reliability. All the results in this paper are fully reproducible with data and code available online.

AB In 2012, Sogou, a major Chinese web search engine released a largescale query log containing 43.5M user interactions, including submitted queries and clicked web page search results. This query log offers a deep sample of queries over a two day period from 30th December 2011 to 1st January 2012. In August 2013, we identified 1.4M predominantly Chinese language unique search result URLs that were clicked at least three times in this query log. We crawled the HTML content of these URLs to construct the supplementary SOGOU2012CRAWL dataset, which we release in this work. A real largescale query log with accompanying crawl such as this offers several opportunities for reproducible information retrieval (IR) research, including query classification, intent modelling and indexing strategy. In this paper we first detail the query log and crawl dataset construction and characteristics. Following this, to demonstrate potential applications we use the crawl to indicatively analyse various timebased patterns in web content and search behaviour. In particular, we study the distribution of languageindependent date expressions in the crawled web content. Based on this, we propose a simple approach for modelling the past/present/future temporal intent of queries based on the date the query was submitted by the user, and the dates appearing in the clicked search results. We observe several prominent temporal patterns which may lead to novel timeaware IR approaches.
