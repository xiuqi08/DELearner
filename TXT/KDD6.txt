AB Hybrid pattern recognition was put forward to discriminate paddy seeds of four different storage periods based on visible/near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (Vis/NIRS). The hybrid pattern recognition included extracting feature and building classifier. A total of 210 samples of paddy seeds, which belonged to four classes, were used for collecting Vis/NIR spectra (3251075 nm) using a field spectroradiometer. The hybrid pattern recognition was integrated with wavelet transform (WT), principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) models. WT was used to eliminate noises and extract characteristic information from spectral data. The characteristic information could be visualized in principal components (PCs) space, in which the structures correlative with the storage periods could be discovered. The first eight PCs, which accounted for 99.94% of the raw spectral data variance, were used as input of the ANN mode, and the model yielded high discrimination accuracy rates of 100%, 100%, 100% and 90% for four classes' samples respectively.

ID ARGUMENTATION
AB In the course of discussion, the group will produce a lot of discussion information, in which the consensus is hided This paper proposes a discussion information-structuring model for consensus building. The model divided a statement into several parts such as premise, warrant, modality, claim etc., according to the Toulmin argument formalism. "Modelity" is designed as a quantitative scale that reflects the expert's attitude to the claim, while premise and warrant are used to provide demonstration for the expert views. We can reach a consensus by computing the value of modality. The model is a comprehensive description of the discussion information, and can effectively manage the discussion information and do consensus building.

AB Based on the cost of internet auctions and the auctioneers' psychological loss aversion, we do a research on the decision-making of multiunit e-auctions. The loss aversion psychology of auctioneers is drawn into the expected utility function model. Meantime, the function of the multiunit e-auctions, which reflects the multiunit e-auction of auctioneers' loss aversion, is established. Then an analysis of the static comparison is made to the influence of the loss aversion coefficient on the optimal length of auction, the number of optimal auction, as well as the prospective goal. Finally, several examples to analyze conclusions are given.

AB angle The paper presents an approach which applies LQ optimal control in Strap-down Inertial Navigation System (SINS) initial alignment. The detailed analysis process about this method has been shown, and anti-jamming designs were done for the approximate step-wise disturbance which appeared in the system, to gain the optimal control parameter the fuzzy neural network is used in the method. Simulations are performed to validate the scheme for initial alignment, obtained the same precision to other alignment method. And the most splendid was that the using of the LQ optimal control reduces the alignment time consumedly, much more quickly than other traditional method. What is discovered in the simulation is while the initial error angles were smaller than 10 degrees; error angle will converge to quite good precision in several seconds.

DE gaussian mixture model (GMM); improved cluster algorithm; linear
   transformation; expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm
ID RECOGNITION
AB The embedded linear transformation is a popular technique which integrates both transformation and diagonal-covariance Gaussian mixture into a unified framework to improve the performance of speaker recognition. However, the mixture number of GMM must be given in model training. The cluster expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is a well-known technique in which the mixture number is regarded as an estimated parameter. This paper presents a new model that integrates an improved cluster algorithm into the estimating process of GMM with the embedded transformation. In the approach, the transformation matrix, the mixture number and other traditional model parameters are simultaneously estimated according to a maximum likelihood criterion. The proposed method is demonstrated on a database of three data sessions for text independent speaker identification. The experiments show that this method outperforms the traditional GMM with cluster EM algorithm.

AB In this paper front bilinear pairings, we propose two ID-based signatures without trusted PKG, which solve the key escrow problem. In the schemes, the PKG is prevented forging a legal user's signature for its traceability. Under random oracle model, our schemes are both proved secure against existential forgery on adaptively chosen message and ID attack, assuming the Computational Diffie-Hellman Problem (CDHP) in Diffie-Hellman group is intractable. By comparison, our schemes have higher efficiency than the existing schemes.

AB The exploding growth of the biomedical literature presents many challenges for biological researchers. One such challenge is from the use of a great deal of abbreviations. Extracting abbreviations and their definitions accurately is very helpful to biologists and also facilitates biomedical text analysis. Among existing approaches, text alignment algorithms are simple, effective and require no training data. However state of the art alignment algorithms could not identify the definitions of irregular abbreviations (e.g., < CNS1, cyclophilin seven suppressor>). We propose an algorithm analogous to pairwise sequence alignment, in which it is given a penalty score if there are two unmatched characters separately from the abbreviation and definition, and in this way some irregular abbreviations are found.

AB In this paper, we systematically explore the search space of frequent sequence mining and present two novel pruning strategies, SEP (Sequence Extension Pruning) and IEP (Item Extension Pruning), which can be used in all Apriori-like sequence mining algorithms or lattice-theoretic approaches. With a little more memory overhead, proposed pruning strategies can prune invalidated search space and decrease the total cost of frequency counting effectively. For effectiveness testing reason, we optimize SPAM [2] and present the improved algorithm, SPAM(SEPIEP), which uses SEP and IEP to prune the search space by sharing the frequent 2-sequences lists. A set of comprehensive performance experiments study shows that SPAM(SEPIEP) outperforms SPAM by a factor of 10 on small datasets and better than 30% to 50% on reasonably large dataset.

AB The agent-oriented (AO) methodology is an effective means for constructing distributed systems. Despite a great deal of research, a number of challenges still exist before making agent-based computing a widely accepted paradigm in software engineering practice. In order to solve the problem of "difficult to implement", the paper presents a method engineering development process for facilitating building up new agent system by reusing method meta models and design patterns. As the supporting tool, the hierarchical development architecture(HDA) plays a key role in the process. To exemplify its feasibility and effectiveness, the construction of C4I system is presented as a case study.

   Infrastructure (PKI); identity authentication; digital watermarking
AB P2P content sharing is often blamed for copyright infringement, making the establishment of DRM technologies an urgent need. A PDRM (P2P-based Digital Rights Management) system is proposed with the support of Next Generation Internet Project. The system is based on a trust model that focuses on content security, fights management and access control. Encryption, digital watermarking, and packaging technologies are adopted to protect the confidentiality and integrity of contents, and support copyrights verifying and piracy tracing. The structure of fights management integrates the distributed and centralized modes, which not only reduces the burdens of networks and rights server, but also provides controllability. The contents downloaded on the P2P networks can be played only with rights control. To realize access control, the password and identity authentication are used. The PDRM system is implemented to prove that it can provide a more robust Intellectual Property protection solution for P2P content delivery.

AB Although Data Field Clustering method has a lot of advantages, clustering result depends severely on affection factor that is selected in Data Field function. The purpose of the paper is to find an optimum affection factor that may not only reflect nature characteristic of clustering data sample, but also reduce influence caused by sample deviation to minimum. In this paper, an affection interval concept is defined at first. Then an optimum objective function for reducing influence of sample deviation is constructed and an approximate solution is given of optimum affection factor. In the end, a standard data set offered in the MATLAB is used to test the availability of the optimum affection factor, the result is satisfactory.

AB While null space based linear discriminant analysis (NLDA) obtains a good discriminant performance, the ability easily suffers from an implicit assumption of Gaussian model with same covariance each class. Meanwhile, mixture model discriminant analysis, which is a good way for processing issues on multiple subclasses in each class, depends on human experience on the number of subclasses and has a highly complex iterative process. Considering the cons and pros of the two mentioned approaches, we therefore propose a new algorithm, called Spectral clustering based Null space Linear Discriminant Analysis (SNLDA). The main contributions of the algorithm include the following three aspects: 1) Employing a new spectral clustering method which can automatically detect the number of clusters in each class. 2) Finding a unified null space for processing multi-subclasses issues with eigen-solution technique. 3) Refining the calculation of the covariance matrix in a single sample subclass. The experimental results show the promising of the proposed SNLDA algorithm.

AB Restart tree is the groundwork for microreboot and recursive recovery, while optimization of restart tree is a key problem in increasing efficiency of recursive recovery. Based on the research of related works, the optimization principle of restart tree is analyzed and a novel approach is proposed for optimizing restart tree. In this approach, mean failure frequencies of components are obtained by injecting exceptions during load testing, which could be used to compute and analyze the failure correlation degrees between components. The components with high failure correlation degrees are constructed as a restart group to realize the optimization of restart tree. The results of the case study show that this approach reduces the mean time to recovery of componentized distributed application and implements the optimization of restart tree.

AB The development of spam techniques and rapid increase of spam amount poses a severe challenge to anti-spam technologies. Given the limitation Of classification based on mail body textual content, this paper focuses on designing the spam discrimination model based on SVM and D-S theory, which uses SVM with probability to classify e-mail, according to the features of mail headers and mail body respectively, and uses D-S Theory to judge the combination result. Experimental result indicates that the proposed model can improve the accuracy of spam identification.

AB In this paper we describe a Query-based summarization system. We propose a practical approach for this task by identifying the sentences with high query-relevant and high information density. This paper introduces a statistical model for query-relevant summarization: adopt Word overlap feature to capture the power of correlation with the query and mine the relations between the sentences. While the first is executed by computing semantic similarity between the sentence and the query, and the other is executed by using semantic graph. Then these two kinds of features are blessed to score each sentence. At last with the help of MMR for reducing redundancy, we get the summary. Experimental results indicate that this method is encouraging for both those retrieved documents that correspondingly concentrating to one subject and retrieved documents who have many subtopics and comparatively being related to the query.

AB A suitable e-learning system management needs to carry out a web-information system in order to allow integrated fruition of data and metadata concerning the activities typical of e-learning environment. The definition of an "Information System" for e-learning takes advantage of the potentialities of Web technologies both as for the access to metadata present on the sever platforms, and as for the implementation of courseware which make tip the relative didactic environment. What information systems have in common is the technological environment on which they are generally implemented and the use of metadata in order to structure information at all cognitive and organization levels. In this work we are going to define a methodology for the implementation of a specific Information System for an e-learning environment.

AB In the field of search, the application of ontology is an important research topic. Introduction of ontology technology in the Retrieval System with massive data can make the searching results more comprehensive. However, now days the ontology is constructed by domain experts, and there are a lot of shortcomings, such as complex process, long time for the project, and difficulty to update. Thereby, in this paper, a method of semiautomaticly building ontology is proposed, after synthetically analyzing a variety of methods and techniques about it. The building process which is based on user interests, mines not only the concepts but also the potential relationships between concepts from the texts by the method of concepts clustering. On the basis of such research, an unique Patent Information Retrieval System based on ontology has been completed.

AB The complexity of a biological system provides a great diversity of correlations among genes/gene clusters, including synchronous and asynchronous co-regulations, each of which can be further divided into two categories: activation and inhibition. Most existing methods can only identify the synchronous activation patterns, such as shifting, scaling and shifting-and-scaling, however, few focuses on capturing both synchronous and asynchronous co-regulations. In this paper, we propose a coding scheme, where two genes with the same code must be co-regulated. Based on the coding scheme, an efficient clustering algorithm is devised to simultaneously capture all known co-regulated relationships (synchronous and asynchronous) among genes/gene clusters. Furthermore, the detailed and complete co-regulation information which, facilitates the study of genetic regulatory networks, can be easily derived from the resulting clusters. Experiments from both real and synthetic microarray datasets prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

AB When more than seven devices to be connected in a Bluetooth scatternet, bridge devices are used to connect two piconets into a scatternet. To deal with possible data transmissions between different piconets, the bridge device must switch to different masters frequently. Suppose that a bridge is serving a piconet and the master in another piconet is calling it at the same time, the calling master has to wait until the bridge completes the previous service. Such transmission delay may accumulate in a long period and the performance of the whole Bluetooth network will degrade significantly. This work tries to smooth the kind of transmission delay in Bluetooth network. This work proposes two new scheduling protocols: the static schedule and the hybrid schedule. This static schedule deals with this kind of coordination among piconets distributedly by applying edge coloring technique. In case of heavy traffic load, the static schedule is expected to perform well. On the other hand, in case of light traffic load, the static schedule may results in long and unavoidable routing delay even there is no transmission between piconets; thus a naive random round-robin schedule in each piconet becomes more appropriate in case of light traffic load. Thus, in the hybrid schedule, each master in its piconet runs round-robin scheme initially; when the traffic load is heavier than a predefined threshold value, it turn to run the static schedule. Also, a new graph model, delay graphs, is proposed to model and estimate the delay time required for the proposed scheduling schemes theoretically. Finally, we conduct simulations by using ns-2 simulator and Bluehoc to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed scheduling protocols.

AB Existing algorithms for utility mining are inadequate on datasets with high dimensions or long patterns. This paper proposes a hybrid method, which is composed of a row enumeration algorithm (i.e., Inter-transaction) and a column enumeration algorithm (i.e., Two-phase), to discover high utility itemsets from two directions: Two-phase seeks short high utility itemsets from the bottom, while Intertransaction seeks long high utility itemsets from the top. In addition, optimization technique is adopted to improve the performance of computing the intersection of transactions. Experiments on synthetic data show that the hybrid method achieves high performance in large high dimensional datasets.

AB This paper proposes a new method of incorporating prior domain knowledge into a kernel based feature selection algorithm. The proposed feature selection algorithm combines the Fast Correlation-Based Filter (FCBF) and the kernel methods in order to uncover an optimal subset of features for the support vector regression. In the proposed algorithm, the Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA) is employed as a measurement of mutual information between feature candidates. Domain knowledge in forms of constraints is used to guide the tuning of the KCCA. In the second experiments, the audit quality research carried by Yang Li and Donald Stokes [1] provides the domain knowledge, and the result extends the original subset of features.

DE bit allocation; feedback channels; image transmission; joint
   source-channel coding (JSCC)
AB In this paper, we consider the Problem of joint source-channel coding for image progressive transmitted over channels with feedback. Feedback routes are provided in many existing standard wireless channels, making rate allocation with feedback a problem of considerable practical importance. We address the question of rate allocation between the source and channel codes in the forward channel, in the presence of feedback information and under a distortion cost function. We show that the presence of feedback shifts the optimal rate allocation point, resulting higher rates for error-correcting codes and smaller overall distortion. Simulations on memoryless channels show that the presence of feedback allows up to about 1.5 dB improvement in PSNR compared to the similarly optimized feed forward scheme.

AB Using the idea of digital image's information sharing, a new hiding approach for multi-image fusion based on NURBS curve is presented The approach makes use of a k-order Non-Uniform Rational B-spline curve with weights to hide information of one image into information of n images. These hiding schemes have more fusion parameters to act as the private keys' which can enhance the security and robustness of the hiding image more. Actually, in the whole image sequence, only p+1 public images do work, so the influence on the recovering result can be decreased, which is caused by the pollution of various noises during public images' transmission. Examples show that these schemes can be realized expediently and have some degree of robustness. These hiding approaches can also be used in the field of digital watermarking and other digital application.

AB The selection of the network nodes and the optimization are very important aspects in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we introduced briefly the basic Principles of the algorithm first, and introduced the GB (Grid-Based) node choice algorithm amply. In succession, the performance for above algorithms was analyzed. Based on performance analysis, some optimizing strategies were put forward. Through relevant simulation experiments, it proved that the optimized algorithm is more accurate and efficiency, the above method would have a certain value of application.

DE environmental distribution map; prediction model; model selection;
   feature selection
AB Currently environmental distribution maps, such as for soil fertility, rainfall and foliage, are widely used in the natural resource management and policy making. One typical example is to predict the grazing capacity in particular geographical regions. This paper uses a discovering approach to choose a prediction model for real-world environmental data. The approach consists of two steps: (1) model selection which determines the type of prediction model, such as linear or non-linear; (2) model optimisation which aims at using less environmental data for prediction but without any loss on accuracy. The latter step is achieved by automatically selecting non-redundant features without using specific models. Various experimental results on real-world data illustrate that using specific linear model can work pretty well and fewer environment distribution maps can quickly make better/comparable prediction with the benefit of lower cost of data collection and computation.

AB We address the protection of private information in data clustering. Previous work focuses on protecting the privacy of data being mined. We find that the cluster labels of individual data points can also be sensitive to data owners. Thus, we propose a privacy-preserving data clustering scheme that extracts accurate clustering rules from private data while protecting the privacy of both original data and individual cluster labels. We derive theoretical bounds on the performance of our scheme, and evaluate it experimentally with real-world data.

AB This paper presents a uniform model for high-rise structure design information and a case base containing 1008 high-rise buildings around the world. A case management system has been implemented with functions of data recording, modification, deletion, inquiry, statistical analysis and knowledge discovery. We propose a data-mining process of mining quantitative association rules for structure form selection from the case base and a method for mining fuzzy association rules. In the fuzzy association rule mining, we present a method for fuzzy interval division and fuzzification of quantitative attributes of the real cases. We demonstrate the application of the Apriori algorithm to generate association rules that can be used in building design. This data mining approach provides a new technical support for design efficiency, quality and intelligence.

ID INTRUSION-DETECTION
AB Intrusion detection system (IDS) has been introduced and broadly applied to prevent unauthorized access to system resource and data for several years. However, many problems are still not well resolved in most of IDS, such as detection evasion, intrusion containment. In order to resolve these problems, we propose a novel flexible architecture VNIDA which is based on virtual machine monitor (VMM) and has no-intrusive behavior to target system after studying popular IDS architectures. In this architecture, a separate intrusion detection domain (IDD) is added to provide intrusion detection services for all virtual machines. Specially, an IDD helper is introduced to take response to the intrusions according to the securiry policies. Moreover, event sensors and IDS stub, as the core components of IDS, are separately isolated from target systems, so strong reliability is also achieved in this architecture. To show the feasibility of the VNIDA, we implement a prototype based on the proposed architecture. Based on the prototype, we employed some rootkits to evaluate our VNIDA, and the results shows that VNIDA has the ability to detect them efficiently, even some potential intrusions. In addition, system performance evaluation also shows that VNIDA only introduce less than 1.25% extra overhead.

AB This paper explores the way in which natural adjacency relation, spatial database are closely integrated through the spatial index for spatial data querying and mining. A Delaunay triangulation approach for constructing spatial index is proposed, which overcomes the conflict between line-intersection computation and natural adjacency isn't satisfying constrained condition of Euclidean distance. Based on this approach, a spatial index prototype for discrete areal objects-Quad GridFile is designed and implemented by using Java extending Oracle Spatial. It demonstrates foundational information extraction ability for geospatial database.

AB By using of combining theoretical model with empirical model, the nonlinear viscoelastic-plastic constitutive equations of soybean and cottonseed were developed on the basis of the creep test. The parameter inverse problem of constitutive model was proposed using improved particles swarm optimization. Numerical simulations of creep of soybean and cottonseed were carried out. The definition of critical pressing time for oil extraction and the method for determining the critical pressing time using creep rate were proposed. The values of critical pressing time for extruded soybean and cottonseed under six applied pressures were evaluated Results indicated that the nonlinear viscoelastic-plastic constitutive model could simulate rheological behaviors of soybean and cottonseed very well. Mean relative deviations between the experimental and predicted values of soybean and cottonseed were 1.55% and 1.93%, respectively. There were significant decreases in the values for the creep rates in the early stage of pressing, and decreases to an insignificant and stabilize value in the later stage.

ID DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; DECOMPOSITION
AB Feature extraction is one of the hot topics in face recognition. However, many face extraction methods will suffer from the "small sample size" problem, such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Direct Linear Discriminant Analysis (DLDA) is an effective method to address this problem. But conventional DLDA algorithm is often computationally expensive and not scalable. In this paper, DLDA is analyzed from a new viewpoint via QR decomposition and an efficient and robust method named DLDA/QR algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm achieves high efficiency by introducing the QR decomposition on a small-size matrix, while keeping competitive classification accuracy. Experimental results on ORL face database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB XML language is widely used as a standard for data representation and exchange among Web applications. In recent years, many efforts have been spent in querying, integrating and clustering XML documents. Measuring the similarity among XML documents is the foundation of such applications. In this paper, we propose a new similarity measure method among the XML documents, which is based on Merge-Edit-Distance (MED). MED upholds the distribution information of the common tree in XML document trees. We urge the distribution information is useful for determining the similarity of XML documents. A novel algorithm is also proposed to calculate MED as follows. Given two XML document trees A and B, it compresses the two trees into one merge tree C and then transforms the tree C to the common tree of A and B with the defined operations such as "Delete", "Reduce", "Combine". The cost of the operation sequence is defined as MED. The experiments on real datasets give the evidence that the proposed similarity measure is effective.

AB Survivability is the ability of a system to continue operating despite the presence of abnormal events such as failures and intrusions. This paper presents a quantitative model of spare resource limited survivability (SRLSQM), based on the definition and four characteristic attributes of network survivability. The executing process of SRLSQM is also illustrated and then the calculating formulas are proposed which include the calculation of restoration rate and system state transition matrixes. The formulas reflect the survivability requirements in network spare resources. At last, a simulation testing is carried through, which demonstrates the feasibility and reliability of our model.

AB In this paper, a representative algorithm convex hull with half-dividing and recurrence is commented,and according to the isomorphic fundamental theorem of the convex hull construction, a more efficient new algorithm to find a convex hull based on the dynamical base line with a maximum pitch of the dynamical base line is given. The general characters of the new algorithm are: I) find out the outside-most poles which are the leftmost, rightmost, topmost and bottommost points of the given 2D point set, i.e. the four initial poles which have the maximum or the minimum coordinate value of the X or Y axis among all the points in the given 2D point set; 2) divide the original distributed domain into four sub-domains with the initial poles; 3) in every sub-domain, construct a current pole with a maximum pitch to its base line based on the last pole got just dynamically and sequentially, and draw the rims of this convex polygon with these poles for intelligent approximating for a convex hull of the given 2D point set step by step.

AB Many convenient graph drawing tools have been developed to visualize the relational information among the large massive data sets. This paper presents a new system for drawing large undirected graphs in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional space, called LGES. It employs a fast novel algorithm to beautify the layouts, which adopts the multi-level method as the framework of the algorithm, and uses the improved force-directed algorithm to refine the single-level layouts. Experiments prove its high performance and nice results. It takes around 5 seconds to draw 10,000 vertex graphs in the two-dimensional space and around 40 seconds in the three-dimensional space. Moreover, the independent components provided by the LGES system are attractive for its further development and application.

AB The rapid increase of multimedia resources makes it difficult for organizing, describing and locating. The method based on ontology is one of the resolving directions, which can simplify resource organization and improve the resource searching efficiency. Based on ontology, we developed a Multimedia Science Paper Generation System (MSPGS). It implements an ontology-based multimedia resource sharing framework. In this paper, three key processes of multimedia resource sharing framework are introduced in detail. First, the ontology based multimedia resource organization structure is proposed; then, we introduce an approach for multimedia description; finally, in order to locate the target multimedia resource accurately and efficiently, the Concept Classified Semantic Search algorithm is described To evaluate the efficiency and precision of the sharing framework, some widely used evaluation methods such as Precision, Recall and F-Measure are used in the experiments. The experimental results show that MSPGS can work well and the proposed multimedia resource sharing framework is effective.

AB Mining frequent patterns has been studied popularly in data mining research. For getting the real useful frequent patterns, one must continually adjust a minimum support threshold. Costly and repeated database scans were done due to not maintaining the frequent patterns discovered. In this paper, we first propose a top-down algorithm for mining frequent patterns, and then present a hybrid algorithm which takes top-down and bottom-up strategies for incremental maintenance of frequent patterns. Efficiency is achieved with the following techniques: large database is compressed into a highly condensed and dynamic frequent pattern tree structure, which avoids repeated database scans, the top-down mining approach adopts a depth first method to avoid the recursive construction and materialization of conditional frequent pattern trees, which dramatically reduces the mining cost. The performance study shows that our algorithm is efficient and scalable for mining frequent patterns, and is an order of magnitude faster than FP growth and Re-mining.

AB Since handwritten Chinese characters' style is uncertain and differs as people differ, this article brings forward a new Average Fuzzy Direction Code based on weight, so as to conquer traditional fuzzy arithmetic's shortcoming that is without enough generalization capability; At the same time it improves association rules in data mining and applies it to the process of handwritten Chinese characters' generalization and picking up of their abstract attributes. Thus exact denotation of handwritten Chinese characters is resolved, and simultaneously it picks up the handwritten Chinese characters' characteristic and mines improved association rules, and further achieves the purpose of handwritten Chinese characters' quick recognition. Therefore it resolves traditional pattern identification's problem of poor adaptability.

AB At present, wind power industry has developed rapidly in our country, and has also promoted the step of wind power plant information construction. But in this process, it's impossible to set up a uniform wind power plant management information system using conventional technology and method, because the wind power plant's devices span a long time, have many categories and the information model and communication protocol are also diverse in different wind turbines. Thus, this paper imports knowledge-sharing-based ontology semantic technology, builds the ontology on the basis of wind power plant information model and describes it using OWL. It achieves the wind power plant information sharing, interaction and procession at the semantic level, and provides a new method to build a uniform wind power plant management information system.

AB Feature selection is one of key issues related with data preprocessing of classification task in a data mining process, Although many efforts have been done to improve typical feature selection algorithms (FSAs), such as filter methods and wrapper methods, it is hard for just one FSA to manage its performances to various datasets. To above problems, we propose another way to support feature selection procedure, constructing proper FSAs to each given dataset. Here is discussed constructive meta-level feature selection that re-constructs proper FSAs with a method repository every given datasets, de-composing representative FSAs into methods. After implementing the constructive meta-level feature selection system, we show how constructive meta-level feature selection goes well with 32 UCI common data sets, comparing with typical FSAs on their accuracies. As the result, our system shows the highest performance on accuracies and the availability to construct a proper FSA to each given data set automatically.

AB The quality of discovered association rules is commonly evaluated by interestingness measures (commonly support and confidence) with the purpose of supplying subsidies to the user in the understanding and use of the new discovered knowledge. Low-quality datasets have a very bad impact over the quality of the discovered association rules, and one might legitimately wonder whether a so-called "interesting" rule noted LHS -> RHS is meaningful when 30% of LHS data are not up-to-date anymore, 20% of RHS data are not accurate, and 15% of LHS data come from a data source that is well-known for its bad credibility. In this paper we propose to integrate data quality measures for effective and quality-aware association rule mining and we propose a cost-based probabilistic model for selecting legitimately interesting rules. Experiments on the challenging KDD-CUP-98 datasets show for different variations of data quality indicators the corresponding cost and quality of discovered association rules that can be legitimately (or not) selected.

AB Mining useful patterns in image databases can not only reveal useful information to users but also help the task of data management. In this paper, we propose an image mining framework, Frequent Spatial Pattern mining in images (FSP), to mine frequent patterns located in a pair of spatial locations of images. A pattern in the FSP is associated with a pair of spatial locations and refers to the occurrence of the same image content in a set of images. This framework is designed to be general so as to accept different levels of representations of image content and different layout forms of spatial representations.

AB In the literature of web search and mining, researchers used to consider the World Wide Web as a flat network, in which each page as well as each hyperlink is treated identically. However, it is the common knowledge that the Web is organized with a natural hierarchical structure according to the URLs of pages. Exploring the hierarchical structure, we found several level-biased characteristics of the Web. First, the distribution of pages over levels has a spindle shape. Second, the average indegree in each level decreases sharply when the level goes down. Third, although the indegree distributions in deeper levels obey the same power law with the global indegree distribution, the top levels show a quite different statistical characteristic. We believe that these new discoveries might be essential to the Web, and by taking use of them, the current web search and mining technologies could be improved and thus better services to the web users could be provided.

AB Mobile user data mining is a field that focuses on extracting interesting pattern and knowledge out from data generated by mobile users. Group pattern is a type of mobile user data mining method. In group pattern mining, group patterns from a given user movement database is found based on spatio-temporal distances. In this paper, we propose an improvement of efficiency using area method for locating mobile users and using sliding window for static group pattern mining. This reduces the complexity of valid group pattern mining problem. We support the use of static method, which uses areas and sliding windows instead to find group patterns thus reducing the complexity of the mining problem.

AB The challenge of privacy-preserving data mining lies in respecting privacy requirements while discovering the original interesting patterns or structures. Existing methods loose the correlations among attributes by transforming the different attributes independently, or cannot guarantee the minimum abstraction level required by legal policies. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving transformation framework for distance-based mining operations based on the concept of privacy-preserving MicroClusters that satisfy a privacy constraint as well as a significance constraint. Our framework well extends the robustness of the state-of-the-art k-anonymity model by introducing a privacy constraint (minimum radius) while keeping its effectiveness by a significance constraint (minimum number of corresponding data records). The privacy-preserving MicroClusters are made public for data mining purposes, but the original data records are kept private. We present efficient methods for generating and maintaining privacy-preserving MicroClusters and show that data mining operations such as clustering can easily be adapted to the public data represented by MicroClusters instead of the private data records. The experiment demonstrates that the proposed methods achieve accurate clusterings results while preserving the privacy.

AB In propositional domains using a separate test set via random sampling or cross validation is generally considered to be an unbiased estimator of true error. In multirelational domains previous work has already noted that linkage of objects may cause these procedures to be biased and has proposed corrected sampling procedures. However, as we show in this paper, the existing procedures only address one particular case of bias introduced by linkage. In this paper we therefore introduce generalized subgraph sampling, a sampling procedure based on bin packing, which ensures that test sets are properly chosen to match the probability of reencountering previously seen objects and which includes previous approaches as a special case. Experiments with data from the Internet Movie Database illustrate the performance of our algorithm.

AB Measuring the similarity for categorical data is a challenging task in data mining due to the poor structure of categorical data. This paper presents a dissimilarity measure for categorical data based on the relations among attributes. This measure not only has the advantage of value variance but also overcomes the limitations of condition the probability-based measure when applied to databases whose attributes are independent, Experiments with 30 databases also showed that the proposed measure boosted the accuracy of Nearest Neighbor classification in comparison with other tested measures.

AB Indexing of motion data is important for quickly searching similar motions for sign language recognition and gait analysis and rehabilitation. This paper proposes a simple and efficient tree structure for indexing motion data with dozens of attributes. Feature vectors are extracted for indexing by using singular value decomposition (SVD) properties of motion data matrices. By having similar motions with large variations indexed together, searching for similar motions of a query needs only one node traversal at each tree level, and only one feature needs to be considered at one tree level. Experiments show that the majority of irrelevant motions can be pruned while retrieving all similar motions, and one traversal of the indexing tree takes only several microseconds with the existence of motion variations.

AB This paper proposes a novel Self-Adaptive Two-Phase Support Vector Clustering algorithm (STPSVC) to cluster multi-relational data. The algorithm produces an appreciate description of cluster contours and then extracts cluster centers information by iteratively performing classification procedure. An adaptive Kernel function is designed to find a desired width parameter for diverse dispersions. Experimental results indicate that the designed Kernel can capture multi-relational features well and STPSVC is of fine performance.

This is a hard nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization problem for which we investigate an efficient technique based on DC (Difference of Convex functions) programming and DCA (DC optimization Algorithm). Preliminary numerical results on some artificial and real-world databases show the efficiency and the superiority of this approach with respect to related existing methods.

AB Moving average transform is known to reduce the effect of noise and has been used in many areas such as econometrics. Previous subsequence matching methods with moving average transform, however, would incur index overhead both in storage space and in update maintenance since the methods should build multiple indexes for supporting axbitrary orders. To solve this problem, we propose a single index approach for subsequence matching that supports moving average transform of arbitrary order. For a single index approach, we first provide the notion of poly-order moving average transform by generalizing the original definition of moving average transform. We then formally prove correctness of the poly-order transform-based subsequence matching. By using the poly-order transform, we also propose two different subsequence matching methods that support moving average transform of arbitrary order. Experimental results for real stock data show that our methods improve average performance significantly, by 22.4 similar to 33.8 times, over the sequential scan.

AB Feature extraction is an important preprocessing step which is encountered in many areas such as data mining, pattern recognition and scientific visualization. In this paper, a new method for sparse feature extraction using local manifold learning is proposed. Similarities in a neighborhood are first computed to explore local geometric structures, producing sparse feature representation. Based on the constructed similarity matrix, linear dimension reduction is applied to enhance similarities among the elements in the same class and extract optimal features for classification performances. Since it only computes similarities in a neighborhood, sparsity in the similarity matrix can give computational efficiency and memory savings. Experimental results demonstrate superior performances of the proposed method.

AB Output coding is a general framework for solving multiclass categorization problems. Some researchers have presented the notion of continuous codes and methods for designing output codes. However these methods are time-consuming and expensive. This paper describes a new framework, which we call Strong-to-Weak-to-Strong (SWS). We transform a "strong" learning algorithm to a "weak" algorithm by decreasing its iterative numbers of optimization while preserving its other characteristics like geometric properties and then make use of the kernel trick for "weak" algorithms to work in high dimensional spaces, finally improve the performances. An inspiring experimental results show that this approach is competitive with the other methods.

AB In the past, we proposed an extended multidimensional pattern relation (EMPR) to structurally and systematically store previously mining information for each inserted block of data, and designed a negative-border online mining (NOM) approach to provide ad-hoc, query-driven and online mining supports. In this paper, we try to use appropriate data structures and design efficient algorithms to improve the performance of the NOM approach. The lattice data structure is utilized to organize and maintain all candidate itemsets such that the candidate itemsets with the same proper subsets can be considered at the same time. The derived lattice-based NOM (LNOM) approach will require only one scan of the itemsets stored in EMPR, thus saving much computation time. In addition, a hashing technique is used to further improve the performance of the NOM approach since many itemsets stored in EMPR may be useless for calculating the counts of candidates. At last, experimental results show the effect of the improved NOM approaches.

ID WRAPPER INDUCTION
AB Online auction Web sites are fast changing and highly dynamic. It is difficult to digest the poorly organized and vast amount of information contained in the auction sites. We develop a unified framework aiming at automatically extracting the product features and summarizing the hot item features across different auction Web sites. One challenge of this problem is to extract useful information from the product descriptions provided by the sellers, which vary largely in the layout format. We formulate the problem as a single graph labeling problem using conditional random fields which can model the relationship among the neighbouring tokens in a Web page, the tokens from different pages, as well as various information such as the hot item features across different auction sites. We have conducted extensive experiments from several real-world auction Web sites to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

AB Mining top-k frequent closed itemsets was initially proposed and exactly solved by Wang et al. [IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 17 (2005) 652-664]. However, in the literature, no research has ever considered the complexity of this problem. In this paper, we present a set of proofs showing that, in the general case, the problem of mining top-k frequent closed itemsets is not in APX. This indicates that heuristic algorithms rather than exact algorithms are preferred to solve the problem.

AB The integration of multimedia semantics is challenging due to the feature-based representation of multimedia data and the heterogeneity among data sources. From human viewpoint, multimedia data objects are often considered as perceptions of the real world, and therefore can be represented at a semantic-entity level in the linguistic domain. This paper proposes a paradigm that facilitates the integration of multimedia semantics in heterogeneous distributed database environments with the help of linguistic analysis. Specifically, we derive a closed set of logic-based form expressions for the efficient computation of multimedia semantic contents, which include conceptual attributes and linguistic relationships into the consideration. In the expression set, the logic terms give a convenient way to describe semantic contents concisely and precisely, providing a representation of multimedia data that is closer to human perception. The space utilization is also improved through the collective representation of similar semantic contents and feature values. In addition, the optimization can be easily performed on logic expressions using mathematical analysis. By replacing long terms with equivalent terms of shorter lengths, the image representation can be automatically optimized. Using a heterogeneous database infrastructure, the proposed method has been simulated and analyzed.

AB Previous work has shown that considering the category distance in the taxonomy tree can improve the performance of text classifiers. In this paper, we propose a new approach to further integrate more categorical information in the text corpus using the principle of multi-objective programming (MOP). That is, we not only consider the distance between categories defined by the branching of the taxonomy tree, but also consider the similarity between categories defined by the document/term distributions in the feature space. Consequently, we get a refined category distance by using MOP to leverage these two kinds of information. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in hierarchical text classification.

AB Although much work has been done on duplicate document detection (DDD) and its applications, we observe the absence of a systematic study of the performance and scalability of large-scale DDD. It is still unclear how various parameters of DDD, such as similarity threshold, precision/recall requirement, sampling ratio, document size, correlate mutually. In this paper, correlations among several most important parameters of DDD are studied and the impact of sampling ratio is of most interest since it heavily affects the accuracy and scalability of DDD algorithms. An empirical analysis is conducted on a million documents from the TREC .GOV collection. Experimental results show that even using the same sampling ratio, the precision of DDD varies greatly on documents with different size. Based on this observation, an adaptive sampling strategy for DDD is proposed, which minimizes the sampling ratio within the constraint of a given precision threshold. We believe the insights from our analysis are helpful for guiding the future large scale DDD work.

AB In this paper, we present a framework for event-driven Clustering Over Multiple Evolving sTreams, which, abbreviated as COMET, monitors the distribution of clusters on multiple data streams and online reports the results. This information is valuable to support corresponding online decisions. Note that as time advances, the data streams are evolving and the clusters they belong to will change. Instead of directly clustering the multiple data streams periodically, COMET applies an efficient cluster adjustment procedure only when it is required. The signal of requiring to do cluster adjustments is defined as an "event." We design a mechanism of event detection which employs piecewise linear approximation as the key technique. The piecewise linear approximation is advantageous in that it can not only be performed in real time as the data comes in, but also be able to capture the trend of data. When an event occurs, through split and merge operations we can report the latest clustering results effectively with high clustering quality.

AB There are many advanced techniques that can efficiently mine frequent itemsets using a minimum support. However, the question that remains unanswered is whether the minimum support can really help decision makers to make decisions. In this paper, we study four summary queries for frequent itemsets mining, namely, 1) finding a support-average of itemsets, 2) finding a support-quantile of itemsets, 3) finding the number of itemsets that greater/less than the support-average, i.e., an approximated distribution of itemsets, and 4) finding the relative frequency of an itemset. With these queries, a decision maker will know whether an itemset in question is greater/less than the support-quantile; the distribution of itemsets; and the frequentness of an itemset. Processing these summary queries is challenging, because the minimum-support constraint cannot be used to prune infrequent itemsets.

AB Web documents are widely replicated on the Internet. These replicated documents bring potential problems to Web based information systems. So replica detection on the Web is an indispensable task. The challenge is to find these duplicated collections from a very large data set with limited hardware resources in acceptable time. In this paper, we first introduce the notion of replica boundary to roughly reflect the situation of the replicas; then we propose an effective and efficient approach to discover the boundary of the replicas. The advantages of the proposed approach include: first, it dramatically reduces pair-wise document similarity computation, making it much faster than traditional replicated document detection approaches; second, it can identify the boundary of the replicated collections accurately, demonstrating to what extent two collections are replicated. On two web page sets containing 24 million and 30 million Web pages respectively, we evaluated the accuracy of the approach.

AB Semi-supervised learning gets estimated marginal distribution P-X with a large number of unlabeled examples and then constrains the conditional probability p(y vertical bar x) with a few labeled examples. In this paper, we focus on a regularization approach for semi-supervised classification. The label information graph is first defined to keep the pairwise label relationship and can be incorporated with neighborhood graph which reflects the intrinsic geometry structure of P-X. Then we propose a novel regularized semi-supervised classification algorithm, in which the regularization term is based on the modified Graph Laplacian. By redefining the Graph Laplacian, we can adjust and optimize the decision boundary using the labeled examples. The new algorithm combines the benefits of both unsupervised and supervised learning and can use unlabeled and labeled examples effectively. Encouraging experimental results are presented on both synthetic and real world datasets.

AB As an important branch of evolvable hardware, evolutionary design of circuit (EDC) is a promising way to realize automated design of complex electronic circuits. To improve EDC in efficiency, scalability and capability of optimization, a novel technique was developed, It features an adaptive multiobjective genetic algorithm and interactions between EDC and data mining. It was validated by the experiments on arithmetic circuits, showing some exciting results. Some circuits evolved are the best ones ever reported in terms of gate count and operating speed. Moreover, some novel knowledge, e.g., efficient and scalable design formulae and generalized transform rules have been discovered by mining the data and results of EDC, which are easy to verify but difficult to dig out by human experts with existing knowledge.

AB In a large time series database, similarity searching is a frequent subroutine to find the similar time series of the given one. In the process, the performance of similarity measurement directly effects the usability of the searching results. The proposed methods mostly use the sum of the distances between the values on the time points, e.g. Euclidean Distance, dynamic time warping (DTW) etc. However, in measuring, they do not consider the hierarchy of each point in time series according to importance. This causes that they cannot accurately and efficiently measure similarity of time series. In the paper, we propose a Multi-Hierarchical Representation (MHR) to replace the original one based on the opinion that the points of one time series should be compared with the ones of another with the same importance in measuring. MHR gives the hierarchies of the points, and then the original one can be represented by the Multi-Hierarchical subseries, which consist of points in the same hierarchy. The distance between the representations can be computed as the measuring result. Finally, the synthetic and real data sets were used in the effectiveness experiments comparing ours with other major methods. And the comparison of their efficiencies was also performed on the real data set. All the results showed the superiority of ours in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

AB The steady growth in the size of data has encouraged the emergence of advanced main memory trie-based data structures. Concurrently, more acute knowledge extraction techniques are devised for the discovery of compact and lossless knowledge formally expressed by generic bases. In this paper, we present an approach for deriving generic bases of association rules. Using this approach, we construct small partially ordered sub-structures. Then, these ordered sub-structures are parsed to derive, in a straightforward manner, local generic association bases. Finally, local bases are merged to generate the global one. Extensive experiments carried out essentially showed that the proposed data structure allows to generate a more compact representation of an extraction context comparatively to existing approaches in literature.

AB The usefulness of the results produced by data mining methods can be critically impaired by several factors such as (1) low quality of data, including errors due to contamination, or incompleteness due to limited bandwidth for data acquisition, and (2) inadequacy of the data model for capturing complex probabilistic relationships in data. Fortunately, a wide spectrum of applications exhibit strong dependencies between data samples. For example, the readings of nearby sensors are generally correlated, and proteins interact with each other when performing crucial functions. Therefore, dependencies among data can be successfully exploited to remedy the problems mentioned above. In this paper, we propose a unified approach to improving mining quality using Markov networks as the data model to exploit local dependencies. Belief propagation is used to efficiently compute the marginal or maximum posterior probabilities, so as to clean the data, to infer missing values, or to improve the mining results from a model that ignores these dependencies. To illustrate the benefits and great generality of the technique, we present its application to three challenging problems: (i) cost-efficient sensor probing, (ii) enhancing protein function predictions, and (iii) sequence data denoising.

DE temporal dense region query; dense region query
AB In this paper, we explore a new problem of "temporal dense region query" to discover the dense regions in the constrainted time intervals which can be separated or not. A Querying tEmporal Dense Region framework (abbreviated as QED) proposed to deal with this problem consists of two phases: (1) an offline maintaining phase, to maintain the statistics of data by constructing a number of summarized structures, RF-trees; (2) an online query processing phase, to provide an efficient algorithm to execute queries on the RF-trees. The QED framework has the advantage that by using the summarized structures, RF-trees, the queries can be executed efficiently without accessing the raw data. In addition, a number of RF-trees can be merged with one another efficiently such that the queries will be executed efficiently on the combined RF-tree. As validated by our empirical studies, the QED framework performs very efficiently while producing the results of high quality.

AB X-ray film mammography and physical examination of the breast are the mainstays for early detection of breast cancer. Unfortunately, error rates for mammograms read by radiologists are high. We examine a particularly difficult to read series of 1618 mammograms where in order to achieve a false positive rate lower than 50%, the false negative rate of radiologists is nearly 25%. We examine a variety of automatic data mining tools in an attempt to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis. Our results suggest that roughly the same or higher accuracy rate than the radiologists can be attained at a much reduced cost. This potential cost savings could have a major financial impact for health care in developing nations.

AB Mining frequent patterns has been studied popularly in data mining research. All of previous studies assume that items in a pattern are unordered. However, the order existing between items must be considered in some applications. In this paper, we first give the formal model of ordered patterns and discuss the problem of mining frequent ordered patterns. Base on our analyses, we present two efficient algorithms for mining frequent ordered patterns. We also present results of applying these algorithms to a synthetic data set, which show the effectiveness of our algorithms.

AB Privacy-preserving classification mining is one of the fast-growing sub-areas of data mining. How to perturb original data and then build a decision tree based on perturbed data is the key research challenge. By applying transition probability matrix this paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving classification ruining algorithm which suits all data types, arbitrary probability distribution of original data, and perturbing all attributes (including label attribute). Experimental results demonstrate that decision tree built using this algorithm on perturbed data has comparable classifying accuracy to decision tree built using un-privacy-preserving algorithm on original data.

TAM-WAP searches the P-tree database in the top-down manner to mine WAR By selectively building intermediate data according to the features of current area to be mined, it can avoid stubbornly building intermediate data for each step of mining process.

AB This talk discusses general IT development in the 21(st) century and its positive and negative effects. It also talks about Korea's IT development and makes suggestions for Korea's further advances in IT. The three keywords to describe the IT development in the 21(st) century are digitalization, convergence, and ubiquitous revolution. This IT development has presented new opportunities for our society, corporations and individuals while posing a threat to us. That is, IT revolution may dramatically improve the quality of human life and allow amazing degree of comfort in our lives, but like a double-edged sword, IT may also be misused and have disastrous impacts on our daily lives, such as invasion of privacy, leakage and abuse of personal information, and hacking. In dealing with these problems, technological advances alone may not be sufficient. There is a need for innovative education regionally and worldwide to cultivate wisdom in U-citizens so that they can use the modem convenience of IT with strong ethics. We also need to establish new laws and societal systems appropriate for the ubiquitous era.

AB A new method for information retrieval which is on the basis of language model with relative entropy and feedback is presented in this paper. The method builds a query language model and document language models respectively for the query and the documents. We rank the documents according to the relative entropies of the estimated document language models with respect to the estimated query language model. The feedback documents are used to estimate a query model by the approach that we assume that the feedback documents are generated by a combined model in which one component is the feedback document language model and the other is the collection language model. Experimental results-show that the method is effective for feedback documents and performs,better than the basic language modeling approach. The results also indicate that the performance of the method is sensitive to both the smoothing parameters and the interpolation coefficients used to estimate the values of the language models.

AB This paper investigates why some companies grow faster than others, by data mining a survey of a large number of companies in Flanders (the northern part of Belgium). Faster or slower average growth over a time period is explained by building a classification tree containing several categorical variables (both quantitative and qualitative). The technique used - called genAID - splits the population at different levels. It is inspired by the Automatic Interaction Detector (AID) technique to find trees that explain the variability in average growth but uses a genetic algorithm to overcome some of the drawbacks of AID. Classical AID or other tree-growing techniques usually generate a single tree for interpretation. This approach has been criticized because, due to the artifacts of data, spurious interactions may occur. genAID offers the user-analyst a set of trees, which are the best ones found over a number of generations of the genetic algorithm. The user-analyst is then offered the choice of choosing a tree by trading off explanatory power against either the ease of understanding or the conformity with an existing theory.

AB Discriminative and generative methods provide two distinct approaches to machine learning classification. One advantage of generative approaches is that they naturally model the prior class distributions. In contrast, discriminative approaches directly model the conditional distribution of class given inputs, so the class priors are only implicitly obtained if the input density is known. In this paper, we propose a framework for incorporating class prior proportions into discriminative methods in order to improve their classification accuracy. The basic idea is to enforce that the distribution of class labels predicted on the test data by the discriminative model is consistent with the class priors. Therefore, the discriminative model has to not only fit the training data well but also predict class labels for the test data that are consistent with the class priors. Experiments on five different UCI datasets and one image database show that this framework is effective in improving the classification accuracy when the training data and the test data come from the same class proportions, even if the test data does not have exactly the same feature distribution as the training data.

DE DNA database; indexing; exact match; wildcard match; k-mismatch
ID SEARCH
AB Exact match queries, wildcard match queries, and k-mismatch queries are widely used in lots of molecular biology applications including the searching of ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tag) and DNA transcription factors. In this paper, we suggest an efficient indexing and processing mechanism for such queries. Our indexing method places a sliding window at every possible location of a DNA sequence and extracts its signature by considering the occurrence frequency of each nucleotide. It then stores a set of signatures using a multi-dimensional index, such as the R-*-tree. Also, by assigning a weight to each position of a window, it prevents signatures from being concentrated around a few spots in indexing space. Our query processing method converts a query sequence into a multi-dimensional rectangle and searches the index for the signatures overlapped with the rectangle.

AB In many data mining applications, cluster analysis is widely used and its results are expected to be interpretable, comprehensible, and usable. Rough set theory is one of the techniques to induce decision rules and manage inconsistent and incomplete information. This paper proposes a method to construct equivalence classes during the clustering process, isolate outlier points and finally deduce a rough set model from the clustering results. By the rough set model, attribute reduction and decision rule induction can be implemented efficiently and effectively. Experiments on real world data show that our method is useful and robust in handling data with noise.

AB The Self-Splitting Competitive Learning (SSCL) is a powerful algorithm that solves the difficult problems of determining the number of clusters and the sensitivity to prototype initialization in clustering. The SSCL algorithm iteratively partitions the data space into natural clusters without a prior information on the number of clusters. However, SSCL suffers from two major disadvantages: it does not have a proven convergence and the speed of learning process is slow. We propose solutions for these two problems. Firstly, we introduce a new update scheme and lead a proven convergence of Asymptotic Property Vector. Secondly, we modify the split-validity to accelerate the learning process. Experiments show these techniques make the algorithm faster than the original one.

AB It is estimated that 20% of genes in the human genome encode for integral membrane proteins (IMPs) and some estimates are much higher. IMPs control a broad range of events essential to the proper functioning of cells, tissues and organisms and are the most common target of clinically useful drugs [1]. However there is a dearth of high-resolution 3D structural information on the IMPs. Therefore good prediction methods of IMPs structures are to be highly valued. In this paper we apply Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to build a probabilistic model to solve the membrane protein helix prediction problem. The advantage of CRFs is that it allows seamless and principled integration of biological domain knowledge into the model. Our results show that the CRF model outperforms other well known helix prediction approaches on several important measures.

AB Conflicts may appear during knowledge processing, where some knowledge pieces are different but they refer to the same subject. Consensus methods are useful in processing inconsistent knowledge. However, for almost conflict situations consensus may be determined but it is not always sensible. In this paper we investigate the aspect of reasonableness of consensus. For this aim we define two notions: consensus susceptibility and consistency measure. Owing to them one may get to know when it is worth to determined a consensus for a conflict. We show the dependencies between consistency and the consensus susceptibility for conflict situations. Some results of the analysis are presented.

AB Data mining on large relational databases has gained popularity and its significance is well recognized. However, the performance of SQL based data mining is known to fall behind specialized implementation. We investigate approaches based on SQL for the problem of finding frequent patterns from a transaction table, including an algorithm that we recently proposed, called Ppropad (Parallel PROjection PAttern Discovery). Ppropad successively projects the transaction table into frequent itemsets to avoid making multiple passes over the large original transaction table and generating a huge sets of candidates. We have built a parallel database system with DB2 and made performance evaluation on it. We prove that data mining with SQL can achieve sufficient performance by the utilization of database tuning.

AB Bayesian spam filters, in general, compute probability est imations for tokens either without considering the email areas of occurrences except the body or treating the same token occurred in different areas as different tokens. However, in reality the same token occurring in different areas are inter-related and the relation too could play role in the classification. In this paper we incorporated this novel idea, co-relating multi-area information by co-weighting them and obtaining more effective combined integrated probability estimations for tokens. The new approach is compared with individual area-wise estimations and traditional separate estimations in all areas, and the experimental results with three public corpora showed significant improvement, stability, robustness and consistency in the spam filtering with the proposed estimation.

AB In the domain of bioinformatics, extracting a relation such as protein-protein interations from a large database of text documents is a challenging task. One major issue with biomedical information extraction is how to efficiently digest the sheer size of unstructured biomedical data corpus. Often, among these huge biomedical data, only a small fraction of the documents contain information that is relevant to the extraction task. We propose a novel query expansion algorithm to automatically discover the characteristics of documents that are useful for extraction of a target relation. Our technique introduces a hybrid query re-weighting algorithm combining the modified Robertson Sparck-Jones query ranking algorithm with a keyphrase extraction algorithm. Our technique also adopts a novel query translation technique that incorporates POS categories to query translation. We conduct a series of experiments and report the experimental results. The results show that our technique is able to retrieve more documents that contain protein-protein pairs from MEDLINE as iteration increases. Our technique is also compared with SLIPPER, a supervised rule-based query expansion technique. The results show that our technique outperforms SLIPPER from 17.90% to 29.98 better in four iterations.

AB Constructing a base set consisting of topic-related web pages is a preliminary step for those web mining algorithms which use the link structure analysis technique based on HITS. However, except checking the anchor text of links and the content of pages, there has been few of research addressing other possibilities to improve topic relevance while collecting the base set. In this paper, we propose a potential hub and authority first (PHA-first) approach utilizing the concept of hub and authority to filter web pages. We investigate the satisfaction of dozens of users about the pages recommended by our method and HITS on different topics. The results indicate that our method is superior to HITS in most cases. In addition, we also evaluate the recall and precision measures of our method. The results show that our method is with relative high precision and low recall for all topics.

AB In molecular biology, DNA sequence matching is one of the most crucial operations. Since DNA databases contain a huge volume of sequences, fast indexes are essential for efficient processing of DNA sequence matching. In this paper, we first point out the problems of the suffix tree, an index structure widely-used for DNA sequence matching, in the respects of the storage overhead, search performance, and difficulty in seamless integration with DBMS. Then, we propose a new index structure that resolves such problems. The proposed index structure consists of the two parts: the primary part realizes the trie as binary bit-string representation without any pointers, and the secondary part helps fast accesses of leaf nodes of the trie that need to be accessed for post-processing. We also suggest efficient algorithms based on that index for DNA sequence matching. To verify the superiority of the proposed approach, we conduct performance evaluation via a series of experiments. The results reveal that the proposed approach, which requires smaller storage space, can be a few orders of magnitude faster than the suffix tree.

AB In many fields and applications, it is critical for users to make or decisions through OLAP queries. How to promote accuracy and efficiency while answering multiple aggregate queries, e.g. COUNT, SUM, AVG, pp MAX, MIN and MEDIAN? It has been the urgent problem in the fields of OLAP and data summarization recently. There have been a few solutions such as MRA-Tree and GENHIST for it. However, they could only answer a certain aggregate query which was defined in a particular data cube with some limited applications. In this paper, we develop a novel framework ADenTS, i.e. Adaptive Density-based Tree Structure, to answer various types of aggregate queries within a single data cube. We represent the whole cube by building a coherent tree structure. Several techniques for approximation are also proposed. The experimental results show that our method outperforms others in effectiveness.

AB Density-based clustering has the advantages for (i) allowing arbitrary shape of cluster and (ii) not requiring the number of clusters as input. However, when clusters touch each other, both the cluster centers and cluster boundaries (as the peaks and valleys of the density distribution) become fuzzy and difficult to determine. In higher dimension, the boundaries become wiggly and over-fitting often occurs. We introduce the notion of cluster intensity function (CIF) which captures the important characteristics of clusters. When clusters are well-separated, CIFs are similar to density functions. But as clusters touch each other, CIFs still clearly reveal cluster centers, cluster boundaries, and, degree of membership of each data point to the cluster that it belongs. Clustering through bump hunting and valley seeking based on these functions are more robust than that based on kernel density functions which are often oscillatory or over-smoothed. These problems of kernel density estimation are resolved using Level Set Methods and related techniques. Comparisons with two existing density-based methods, valley seeking and DBSCAN, are presented to illustrate the advantages of our approach.

AB A time-profiled association is an association pattern consistent with a query sequence over time, e.g., identifying the interacting relationship of droughts and wild fires in Australia with the El Nino phenomenon in the past 50 years. Traditional association rule mining approaches reveal the generic dependency among variables in association patterns but do not capture the evolution of these patterns over time. Incorporating the temporal evolution of association patterns and identifying the co-occurring patterns consistent over time can be done by time-profiled association mining. Mining time-proflled associations is computationally challenging due to the large size of the itemset space and the long time points in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel one-step algorithm to unify the generation of statistical parameter sequences and sequence retrieval. The proposed algorithm substantially reduces the itemset search space by pruning candidate itemsets based on the monotone property of the lower bounding measure of the sequence of statistical parameters. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms a naive approach.

AB Cluster analysis is one of main methods used in data mining. So far there have existed many cluster analysis approaches such as partitioning method, density-based, k-means, k-nearest neighborhood, etc. Recently, some researchers have explored a few kernel-based clustering methods, e.g., kernel-based K-means clustering. The new algorithms have demonstrated some advantages. So it's needed to explore the basic principle underlain the algorithms such as whether the kernel function transformation can increase the separability of the input data in clustering and how to use the principle to construct new clustering methods. In this paper, we will discuss the problems.

AB There are many techniques developed for tackling time series and most of them consider every part of a sequence equally. In many applications, however, recent data can often be much more interesting and significant than old data. This paper defines new recent-biased measures for distance and energy, and proposes a recent-biased technique based on DWT for time series in which more recent data are considered more significant. With such a recent-biased technique, the dimension of time series can be reduced while effectively preserving the recent-biased energy. Our experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach for handling time series.

AB Symbolization is a useful method for mining time series. As our experimental results demonstrated, the previous methods are not accurate enough due to their limitations in handling a prevalent kind of time series in which similar movements are often with different lengths. This paper considers the accuracy issue of symbolization of time series. We propose a novel approach that emphasizes the meaning of each movement in the time series, regardless of the length or shift of it. To make the proposed approach more practicable, we also provide a semiautomatic method for setting the parameters. The nature of the problem and the performance of our approach had been analyzed on both real data and synthetic data. Experimental results justified the superiority of our approach over the previous one and gave some useful empirical conclusions.

AB To locate information embedded in documents, information extraction systems based on rule-based pattern matching have long been used. To further improve the extraction generalization, hidden Markov model (HMM) has recently been adopted for modeling temporal variations of the target patterns with promising results. In this paper, a state-merging method is adopted for learning the topology with the use of a localized Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence. The proposed system has been applied to a set of domain-specific job advertisements and preliminary experiments show promising results.

AB In retail industry, it is very important to understand seasonal sales pattern, because this knowledge can assist decision makers in managing inventory and formulating marketing strategies. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is suitable for extracting and illustrating essential structures because SOM has unsupervised learning and topology preserving properties, and prominent visualization techniques. In this experiment, we propose a method for seasonal pattern analysis using Self-Organizing Map. Performance test with real-world data from stationery stores in Indonesia shows that the method is effective for seasonal pattern analysis. The results are used to formulate several marketing and inventory management strategies.

AB Inductive queries are queries to an inductive database that generate a set of patterns in a data mining context. Inductive querying poses new challenges to database and data mining technology. We study conjunctive inductive queries, which are queries that can be written as a conjunction of a monotonic and an anti-monotonic subquery. We introduce the conjunctive inductive query optimization problem, which is concerned with minimizing the cost of computing the answer set to a conjunctive query. In the optimization problem, it is assumed that there are costs c. and c, associated to evaluating a pattern w.r.t. a monotonic and an anti-monotonic subquery respectively. The aim is then to minimize the total cost needed to compute all solutions to the query. Secondly, we present an algorithm that aims at optimizing conjunctive inductive queries in the context of the pattern domain of strings and evaluate it on a challenging data set in computational biology.

AB This paper investigates a number of techniques for calibration of the output of a Support Vector Machine in order to provide a posterior probability P(target class\instance).
   Five basic calibration techniques are combined with five ways of correcting the SVM scores on the training set. The calibration techniques used are addition of a simple ramp function, allocation of a Gaussian density, fitting of a sigmoid to the output and two binning techniques. The correction techniques include three methods that are based on recent theoretical advances in leave-one-out estimators and two that are variants of hold-out validation set. This leads us to thirty different settings (including calibration on uncorrected scores). All thirty methods are evaluated for two linear SVMs (one with linear and one with quadratic penalty) and for the ridge regression model (regularisation network) on three categories of the Reuters Newswires benchmark and the WebKB dataset. The performance of these methods are compared to both the probabilities generated by a naive Bayes classifier as well as a calibrated centroid classifier.
   The main conclusions of this research are: (i) simple calibrators such as ramp and sigmoids perform remarkably well, (ii) score correctors using leave-one-out techniques can perform better than those using validation sets, however, cross-validation methods allow more reliable estimation of test error from the training data.

The Minimum Message Length (MML) principle has demonstrated its ability in discovering linear causal models from training data. To explore the ways to improve efficiency, this paper proposes a novel Markov Blanket identification algorithm based on the Lasso estimator. For each variable, this algorithm first generates a Lasso tree, which represents a pruned candidate set of possible feature sets. The Minimum Message Length principle is then employed to evaluate all those candidate feature sets, and the feature set with minimum message length is chosen as the Markov Blanket. Our experiment results show the ability of this algorithm. In addition, this algorithm can be used to prune the search space of causal discovery, and further reduce the computational cost of those score-based causal discovery.. algorithms.

AB Data mining has attracted a lot of research efforts during the past decade. However, little work has been reported on supporting a large number of users with similar data mining tasks. In this paper, we present a data mining proxy approach that provides basic services so that the overall performance of the system can be maximized for frequent itemset mining. Our data mining proxy is designed to fast respond a user's request by constructing the required tree using both trees in the proxy that are previously built for other users' requests and trees stored on disk that are pre-computed from transactional databases. We define a set of basic operations on pattern trees including tree projection and tree merge. Our performance study indicated that the data mining proxy significantly reduces the I/O cost and CPU cost to construct trees. The frequent pattern mining costs with the trees constructed can be minimized.

AB Organizational coevolutionary algorithm for classification (OCEC), is designed with the intrinsic properties of data mining in mind. OCEC makes groups of examples evolved, and then rules are extracted from these groups of examples at the end of evolution. OCEC is first compared with G-NET and JoinGA. All results show that OCEC achieves a higher predictive accuracy. Then, the scalability of OCEC is studied. The results show that the classification time of OCEC increases linearly.

AB The cross-sectional time series data means a group of multivariate time series each of which has the same set of variables. Usually its length is short. It occurs frequently in business, economics, science, and so on. We want to mine rules from it, such as "GDP rises if Investment rises in most provinces" in economic analysis. Rule mining is divided into two steps: events distilling and association rules mining. This paper concentrates on the former and applies Apriori to the latter. The paper defines event types based on relative differences. Considering cross-sectional property, we introduce an ANOVA-based event-distilling method which can gain proper events from cross-sectional time series. At last, the experiments on synthetic and real-life data show the advantage of ANOVA-based event-distilling method and the influential factors, relatively to the separately event-distilling method.

AB Generic ensemble methods can achieve excellent learning performance, but are not good candidates for active learning because of their different design purposes. We investigate how to use diversity of the member classifiers of an ensemble for efficient active learning. We empirically show, using benchmark data sets, that (1) to achieve a good (stable) ensemble, the number of classifiers needed in the ensemble varies for different data sets; (2) feature selection can be applied for classifier selection from ensembles to construct compact ensembles with high performance. Benchmark data sets and a real-world application are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB In many cases, normal uses of a system form patterns that will repeat. The most common patterns can be collected into a prediction model which will essentially predict that usage patterns common in the past will occur again in the future. Systems can then use the prediction models to provide advance notice to their implementations about how they are likely to be used in the near future. This technique creates opportunities to enhance system implementation performance since implementations can be better prepared to handle upcoming usage. The key component of our system is the ability to intelligently learn about system trends by tracking file system and memory system activity patterns. The usage data that is tracked can be subsequently queried and visualized. More importantly, this data can also be mined for intelligent qualitative and quantitative system enhancements including predictive file prefetching, selective file compression and and application-driven adaptive memory allocation. We conduct an in-depth performance evaluation to demonstrate the potential benefits of the proposed system.

AB Health databases are characterised by large number of records, large number of attributes and mild density. This encourages data miners to use methodologies that are more sensitive to health undustry specifics. For conceptual mining, the classic pattern-growth methods are found limited due to their great resource consumption. As an alternative, we propose a pattern splitting technique which delivers as complete and compact knowledge about the data as the pattern-growth techniques, but is found to be more efficient.

AB Clustering analysis has been applied in a wide variety of fields. In recent years, it has even become a valuable and useful technique for in-silico analysis of microarray or gene expression data. Although a number of clustering methods have been proposed, they are confronted with difficulties in the requirements of automation, high quality, and high efficiency at the same time. In this paper, we explore the issue of integration between clustering methods and validation techniques. We propose a novel, parameter-less, and efficient clustering algorithm, namely CST, which is suitable for analysis of gene expression data. Through experimental evaluation, CST is shown to outperform other clustering methods substantially in terms of clustering quality, efficiency, and automation under various types of datasets.

DE naive Bayes; Bayesian network; machine learning
AB The naive Bayes classifier is widely used in interactive applications due to its computational efficiency, direct theoretical base, and competitive accuracy. However, its attribute independence assumption can result in sub-optimal accuracy. A number of techniques have explored simple relaxations of the attribute independence assumption in order to increase accuracy. TAN is a state-of-the-art extension of naive Bayes, that can express limited forms of inter-dependence among attributes. Rough sets theory provides tools for expressing inexact or partial dependencies within dataset. In this paper, we present a variant of TAN using rough sets theory and compare their tree classifier structures, which can be thought of as a selective restricted trees Bayesian classifier. It delivers lower error than both pre-existing TAN-based classifiers, with substantially less computation than is required by the SuperParent approach.

AB As the world-wide-web grows rapidly and a user's browsing experiences are needed to be personalized, the problem of predicting a user's behavior on a web-site has become important. We present a probability model to utilize path profiles of users from web logs to predict the user's future requests. Each of the user's next probable requests is given a conditional probability value, which is calculated according to the function presented by us. Our model can give several predictions ranked by the values of their probability instead of giving one, thus increasing recommending ability. The experiments show that our algorithm and model has a good performance. The result can potentially be applied to a wide range of applications on the web.

AB This paper presents a method to summarize massive spacecraft telemetry data by extracting significant event and change patterns in the low-level time-series data. This method first transforms the numerical time-series into a symbol sequence by a clustering technique using DTW distance measure, then detects event patterns and change points in the sequence. We demonstrate that our method can successfully summarize the large telemetry data of an actual artificial satellite, and help human operators to understand the overall system behavior.

AB In this paper, the impact of the size of the training set on the benefit from ensemble, i.e, the gains obtained by employing ensemble learning paradigms, is empirically studied. Experiments on Bagged/ Boosted J4.8 decision trees with/without pruning show that enlarging the training set tends to improve the benefit from Boosting but does not significantly impact the benefit from Bagging. This phenomenon is then explained from the view of bias-variance reduction. Moreover, it is shown that even for Boosting, the benefit does not always increase consistently along with the increase of the training set size since single learners sometimes may learn relatively more from additional training data that are randomly provided than ensembles do. Furthermore, it is observed that the benefit from ensemble of unpruned decision trees is usually bigger than that from ensemble of pruned decision trees. This phenomenon is then explained from the view of error-ambiguity balance.

AB An automated data mining service offers an out-sourced, cost-effective analysis option for clients desiring to leverage their data resources for decision support and operational improvement. In the context of the service model, typically the client provides the service with data and other information likely to aid in the analysis process (e.g. domain knowledge, etc.). In return, the service provides analysis results to the client. We describe the required processes, issues, and challenges in automating the data mining and analysis process when the high-level goals are: (1) to provide the client with a high quality, pertinent analysis result; and (2) to automate the data mining service, minimizing the amount of human analyst effort required and the cost of delivering the service. We argue that by focusing on client problems within market sectors, both of these goals may be realized.

AB In this paper, we propose an efficient cell-based clustering method for handling a large of amount of high-dimensional data. Our clustering method provides an efficient cell creation algorithm using a space-partitioning technique and a cell insertion algorithm to construct clusters as cells with more density than a given threshold. To achieve good retrieval performance on clusters, we also propose a new filtering-based index structure using an approximation technique. In addition, we compare the performance of our cell-based clustering method with the CLIQUE method in terms of cluster construction time, precision, and retrieval time. The experimental results show that our clustering method achieves better performance on cluster construction time and retrieval time.

AB Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is an efficient technique for relational data mining, but when ILP is applied in imperfect domains, the rules induced by ILP often struggle with the overfitting problem. This paper proposes a method to learn first-order Bayesian network (FOBN) which can handle imperfect data powerfully. Due to a high computation cost for directly learning FOBN, we adapt an ILP and a Bayesian network learner to construct FOBN. We propose a feature extraction algorithm to generate features from ILP rules, and use these features as the main structure of the FOBN. We also propose a propositionalisation algorithm for translating the original data into the single table format to learn the remaining parts of the FOBN structure and its conditional probability tables by a standard Bayesian network learner.

AB Data cubes facilitate fast On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP). Iceberg cubes are special cubes comprise only the multidimensional groups satisfying some user-specified constraints. Previous algorithms have focused on iceberg cubes defined by relatively simple constraints such as "COUNT(*) greater than or equal to delta" and "COUNT(*) greater than or equal to delta AND AVG(Profit) greater than or equal to alpha". We propose an algorithm I-Cubing that computes iceberg cubes defined by complex constraints involving multiple predicates of aggregates such as "COUNT(*) greater than or equal to delta AND (AVG(Profit) greater than or equal to alpha OR AVG(profit) less than or equal to beta)". State-of-the-art iceberg cubing algorithms: BUC cannot handle such cases whereas H-Cubing has to incur extra cost. Our proposed bounding technique can prune for all the given constraints at once without extra cost. Experiments show that bounding has superior pruning power and I-Cubing is twice as fast as H-Cubing. Furthermore, I-Cubing performs equally well with more complex constraints.

This paper deals with an aspect of workflows which has not so far received much attention: providing facilities for the human system administrator to monitor the actual behavior of the workflow system in order to predict the "most probable" workflow executions. In this context, we develop a data mining algorithm for identifying frequent patterns, i.e., the workflow substructures that have been scheduled more frequently by the system. Several experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the standard approaches adapted to mining frequent instances.

AB This paper proposes a framework for exploiting hierarchical structures of feature domain values in order to improve classification performance under Bayesian learning framework. Inspired by the statistical technique called shrinkage, we investigate the variances in the estimation of parameters for Bayesian learning. We develop two algorithms by maintaining a balance between precision and robustness to improve the estimation. We have evaluated our methods using two real-world data sets, namely, a weather data set and a yeast gene data set. The results demonstrate that our models benefit from exploring the hierarchical structures.

AB We present a new and simple algorithm for learning large margin classifiers that works in a truly online manner. The algorithm generates a linear classifier by averaging the weights associated with several perceptron-like algorithms run in parallel in order to approximate the Bayes point. A random subsample of the incoming data stream is used to ensure diversity in the perceptron solutions. We experimentally study the algorithm's performance on online and batch learning settings. The online experiments showed that our algorithm produces a low prediction error on the training sequence and tracks the presence of concept drift. On the batch problems its performance is comparable to the maximum margin algorithm which explicitly maximises the margin.

AB K.D.D. (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) methods and methodologies nearly all imply the retrieval of one or several structures of a data set. In practice, using those methods may give rise to a bunch of problems (excessive computing time, parameters settings,...). We show in this paper that some of these problems can be solved via the construction of a global structure starting from a set of sub-structures. We thus propose a method for aggregating a set of partial structures into a global one and then present how this method can be used for solving several traditional practical problems of K.D.D....

AB This paper regards bookmarking as the most important information to extract user preferences among user behaviors. Bookmarks are categorized on Bayesian networks by an ontology. Considering the relationships between categories, evidential supports are mutually propagated to improve the coverage of the potential preferences. Consequently, we have attempted to define bookmarking behaviors and apply them to the weight updating on users' preference map. We have measured the causal rate in order to improve accuracy of evidential supports and retrieved relational information between the behavioral patterns and user preferences throught temporally analyzing these patterns. For experiments, we made a dataset organized as 2718 bookmarks and had monitored 12 users' behaviors for 30 days(1).

AB The discovery of association relationship among the data in a huge database has been known to be useful in selective marketing, decision analysis, and business management. A significant amount of research effort has been elaborated upon the development of efficient algorithms for data mining. However, without fully considering the time-variant characteristics of items and transactions, it is noted that some discovered rules may be expired from users' interest. In other words, some discovered knowledge may be obsolete and of little use, especially when we perform the mining schemes on a transaction database of short life cycle products. This aspect is, however, rarely addressed in prior studies. To remedy this, we broaden in this paper the horizon of frequent pattern mining by introducing a weighted model of transaction-weighted association rules in a time-variant database. Specifically, we propose an efficient Progressive Weighted Miner (abbreviatedly as PWM) algorithm to perform the mining for this problem as well as conduct the corresponding performance studies. In algorithm PWM, the importance of each transaction period is first reflected by a proper weight assigned by the user. Then, PWM partitions the time-variant database in light of weighted periods of transactions and performs weighted mining. Algorithm PWM is designed to progressively accumulate the itemset counts based on the intrinsic partitioning characteristics and employ a filtering threshold in each partition to early prune out those cumulatively infrequent 2-itemsets. With this design, algorithm PWM is able to efficiently produce weighted association rules for applications where different time periods are assigned with different weights and lead to results of more interest.

AB The importance of forecasting cannot be overemphasized in modern environment surveillance applications, including flood control, rainfall analysis, pollution study, nuclear leakage prevention and so on. That is why we proposed STIFF (SpatioTemporal Integrated Forecasting Framework) in previous work [11], trying to answer such a challenging problem of doing forecasting in natural environment with both spatial and temporal characteristics involved. However, despite its promising performance on univariate-based data, STIFF is not sophisticated enough for more complicated environmental data derived from multiple correlated variables. Therefore in this paper we add multivariate analysis to the solution, take the correlation between different variables into account and further extend STIFF to address spatiotemporal forecasting involving multiple variables. Our experiments show that this introduction and integration of multivariate correlation not only has a more reasonable and rational interpretation of the data itself, but also produces a higher accuracy and slightly more balanced behavior.

AB We present a method for automatic extraction of protein interactions from scientific abstracts by combing machine learning and knowledge-based strategies. This method. uses sample sentences, which are parsed by a link grammar parser, to learn extraction rules automatically. By incorporating heuristic rules based on morphological clues and domain specific knowledge, this method can remove the interactions that are not between proteins and improve the performance of extraction process. We present experimental results for a test set of MEDLINE abstracts. The results are encouraging and demonstrate the feasibility of our method to perform accurate extraction without need of manual rule building.

AB The output of boolean association rule mining algorithms is often too large for manual examination. For dense datasets, it is often impractical to even generate all frequent itemsets. The closed itemset approach handles this information overload by pruning "uninteresting" rules following the observation that most rules can be derived from other rules. In this paper, we propose a new framework, namely, the generalized closed (or g-closed) itemset framework. By allowing for a small tolerance in the accuracy of itemset supports, we show that the number of such redundant rules is far more than what was previously estimated. Our scheme can be integrated into both levelwise algorithms (Apriori) and two-pass algorithms (ARMOR). We evaluate its performance by measuring the reduction in output size as well as in response time. Our experiments show that incorporating g-closed itemsets provides significant performance improvements on a variety of databases.

AB ProsMine is a system for automatically predicting protein structural class from sequence, based on using a combination of data mining techniques. Contrary to our previous protein structural class prediction system, where only enzyme proteins can be predicted, ProsMine can predict the structural class for all of the proteins. We investigate the most effective way to represent protein sequences in our new prediction system. Based on the lattice theory, our idea is to discover the set of Closed Sequences from the protein sequence database and use those appropriate Closed Sequences as protein features. A sequence is said to be "closed" for a given protein sequence database if it is the maximal subsequence of all the protein sequences in that database. Efficient algorithms have been proposed for discovering closed sequences and selecting appropriate closed sequence for each protein structural class. Experimental results, using data extracted from SWISS-PROT and CATH databases, showed that ProsMine yielded better accuracy compared to our previous work even for the most specific level (Homologous-Superfamily Level) of the CATH protein structure hierarchy, which consists of 637 possible classes.

AB The Web serves as a global information service center that contains vast amount of data. The Website structure should be designed effectively so that users can efficiently find their information. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a graph-based optimization algorithm to modify Website topology using interesting association rules. The interestingness of an association rule A double right arrow B is defined based on the probability measure between two sets of Web pages A and B in the Website. If the probability measure between A and B is low (high), then the association rule A double right arrow B has high (low) interest. The hyperlinks in the Website can be modified to adapt user access patterns according to association rules with high interest. We present experimental results and demonstrate that our method is effective.

AB The paper proposed a new method based on the multi-edited nearest neighbor rule to prevent decision tree algorithms from growing a tree of unnecessary large size and hence partially alleviate the problem of "over-training". For this purpose, two useful prosperities of the multi-edited nearest neighbor rule are investigated. Experiments show that the method proposed could drastically reduce the size of resulting trees, significantly enhance their understandability, and meanwhile improve the test accuracy when the control parameter takes an appropriate value.

AB This paper presents a method of mining HTML documents into structured documents and of filtering structured documents by using both slot weighting and token weighting. The goal of a mining algorithm is to find slot-token patterns in HTML documents. In order to express user interests in structured document filtering, slot and token are considered. Our preference computation algorithm applies vector similarity and Bayesian probability to filter structured documents. The experimental results show that it is important to consider hyperlinking and unlablelling in mining HTML texts; slot and token weighting can enhance the performance of structured document filtering.
